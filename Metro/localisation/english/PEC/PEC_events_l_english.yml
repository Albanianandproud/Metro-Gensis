 nf_PEC.7.d: "With the disintergration of Petchaniki government, the bandits upon Kozhukhovskaya have chosen to extend their operations from outside the station.

 nf_PEC.8.t: "The Esoteric Herald"
 nf_PEC.8.d: "Partially due to Stepanov recent demise, Golubev has spurred his followers into a fanatical frenzy. Espousing that the day has arrived that the southern metro must be dredged. Their god calls to him, and someplace in the deep south will his form take shape in our universe. His lackeys refuse to take work sorties, and prepare themselves for this."

 nf_PEC.11.d: "The rabble are lead by a man named Borman. Serving as the Pakhan of the local crime syndicate, his crime outfit regularly harass and belittle merchant vessels, and attempt at charging an exorbutant amount for 'protection' passing through Kozhukhovskaya. Although unlike other bandit stations, Bormann keeps his brigands from harassing local of the Petchaniki or commiting much crime at all for that matter.

 nf_PEC.12.t: "Dealing with the Narco-Mafia"
 nf_PEC.12.d: "Settled upon Kozhukhovskaya, Bormanns gang are firmly entrenched at that station peddling dope and coercing passing traders to pay the hefty toll.

 nf_PEC.13.t: "Brotherhood of the Yellow Sign"
 nf_PEC.13.d: "The Unfortunate rumours which plague Petchaniki station do indeed have some layer of truth. The majority of the population like most stations are good hardworking folk; but a few bad apples spoil the whole reputation of the bunch. Calling themselves the Brotherhood in Yellow, and draped in tattered rags - which give the impression of piss-stains rathern than yellow pigment; Golubev's rabble are no more keen on his maddened rambles as they are waiting to get their next warm meal. Believing that the apocalypse was the inaugeral step into execution their plans to bring their god into our realm of existence. Our security forces aren't quite sure when this Golubev individual turned up, or if he had always lived on Petchaniki station. Some believe he came wading straight from the southern tunnels themselves. Whatever the case may be, his followers have come to idolize him and much more his ideals.\n\nGolubev has accrued a rather sizable arsenal of weapons and firearms, our security forces a lead to believe. Hiding them in stashes out from prying eyes. Golubev swears certainty that their 'God' will come in corporeal form in the south, once those stations have been dredged."
 nf_PEC.13.a: "Rambles aside, we could use those weapons"
 nf_PEC.13.a.tooltip: "We'll approach Golubev. As long as we don't draw ire of this small cult rabble, Golubev may wish to help assist our Military with his supplies. Hopefully he'll tell his followers to shower, also."
