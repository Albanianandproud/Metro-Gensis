To many reunification of East and West was seen as a fruitful beginning, but for Amsels family it only brought hardship. With her father left utterly baffled and defeated with losing his post following the collapse of the Berlin Wall; his purpose to Socialism ultimately all for naught. With difficulty finding work he eventually succumbed to vices; never attaining any modicum of triump ever.\n\nAlita, on the other hand through steadfast determination and an iron resolve shares the same vision of her late father to uphold true socialist ideals, Amsel looks towards the bleak future as the past paroxysmally rears itself into the present. There is hope for the new §YEuropa Workers Republic§! yet underneath her strategic, uncompromising and frankly ruthless command."
