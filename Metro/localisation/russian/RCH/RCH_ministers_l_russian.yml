  ### Country Leaders ###
  RCH_fuhrer:0 "The Fuhrer"
  RCH_FUHRER_DESC:0 "Evgeny Petrovich is a man in his mid-40s, scarred and bruised like the insidious ideology he so practises. Almost nothing is known about his past, although his involvement in the neo-nazi politiking of the Fourth Reich is apparent; Only recently taking the mantle of Fuhrer. Seeking to reorganize the hermitic fascists of the Fourth Reich into a metromacht truly feared by the denizens of the Metro."
  
  RCH_danila_kreipp:0 "Danila Kreipp"
  RCH_KREIPP_DESC:0 "Once a handsome man in his prime; otherwise aryan features left to fester and rot. Craven for power he was Banished onto the surface for his trechary against the Fuhrer during his rise to power over the Fascists. Kreipp has done the remarkable, returned. His face scarred and bruised but his mind strengthened. His tenacious resolve mixed with his discoveries has forever changed him.\n Now with his rule unquestioned he seeks to dabble into occultism. Blending the science and superstition with supernatural forces."
  
  RCH_vadim_tulpanov:0 "Vadim Tulpanov"
  RCH_TULPANOV_DESC:0 "With the Fuhrer gone, command has been thrusted upon him from below the chain of command. Reluctant at first to lead the distraught Reich, Tulpanov seeks to reclaim what has been originally lost, and mend back together what is left of the pieces."
  RCH_vadim:0 "Vadim"
  RCH_vadim_tulpanov:0 "Vadim Tulpanov"

  RCH_roman_orlov:0 "Roman Orlov"
  RCH_roman_orlov_desc:0 "Holding both the Gestapo and Kriminalpolizei chair role. He has the immense task with snuffing out any and all dissent both within and without the Party. A role he does not take lightly. Ideologically fanatical to the ideals of the Reich and loyal only to the furher."
  RCH_ORLOV_DESC:0 "Holding immense power within the Reich, it was only a natural progression for him to assume leadership. With the Fuhrer gone, Orlov power has grown significantly. Once no more than a gaunt-teenager struggling to feed himself like many others following WW3. His father was arrested by Central Metro Command officers and charged with stealing rations, and later was found lying in their captivity dead. Leaving Orlov with a bitter scorn. He will make damn well sure Hanza; Invisible Watchers or whatever other metro-wide cabals will be brought to the light."

  RCH_chairman_of_ministry_desc:0 ""
  _RCH_industry_minister:0 "Chairman of Industry"

  RCH_volkov:0 "Gauleiter Volkov"
  RCH_volkov_desc:0 "Gauleiter Volkov, also known simply as 'wolf' is one of the most prestigous of Führer's confidants. Wolf heads and oversees all activity within the Pushkinskaya station. Nothing goes on without his watchful eyes and consent."
  
  RCH_kommandant:0 "Mr Commandant"
  RCH_kommandant_desc:0 "With the ability to climb the political ladder thanks in part to his 'slavic' looks, Mr Commandant is the current head of Tverskaya Station."

  RCH_taras_bannyi:0 "Taras Bannyi"
  RCH_taras_bannyi_desc:0 "Gauleiter of Chekhovskaya station, Taras hails from Western Ukraine as is an ardent supporter of National Socialism. Thanks in part to his cruelty does he maintain a bloody rule. One he very much reaps the benefit of."

  RCH_propaganda_minister:0 "Vitaliy Rogulsky"
  RCH_propaganda_minister_desc:0 "Born sometime in the mid-to-late 80s and growing up into a military family Vitaliy found it difficult to live up to his familys legacy. Three generations of staunch soviet warriors cut to pieces following an early diagnosis of bronchiectasis in Rogulskys' youth.\nDespite unable to pursue the legacy of his families profession, Rogulsky found an interest in literature and sought to pursue a career in writing. Even considering his fathers initial disaproval, which Rogulsky bore the brunt of, a teenage Rogulsky managed to land an initial job position within a writing firm, and later as a journalist writing right-leaning tabloid articles with varying degrees of success.\n\nIn his early 20s he became a member of the RNU, much to the dismay of his family. With his ardent fanaticism to right-wing dogma he found himself quickly rising the ranks of the RNU. As the bombs dropped, he sought shelter underground amongst his ilk, from there they wandered to and from station, seeking to incite others to their ideology.\n\nThanks in part to his natural speaking skills, but most importantly to his loyalty to Petrovich, Rogulsky was sworn in to the position Propaganda Minister. His ailment kept under wraps away from prying eyes abound. His role ensures that the numerous denizens of the Reich remain staunchly loyal, and most importantly complacent."

  RCH_karl_krainer:0 "Karl Krainer"
  RCH_karl_krainer_desc:0 "Karl Krainer was born in 2003, just two years before the nuclear war that devastated the world. His parents were Baltic immigrants who moved to Russia before the great war. They were hardworking and instilled discipline and strong values in their son. Karl's childhood was uneventful, but he was a smart and ambitious child. He excelled in school, particularly in history and politics, and dreamed of one day becoming a politician.\n When the war broke out, Karl's parents were killed in the initial blasts, and he was left alone to fend for himself in the harsh new world. He quickly learned how to survive in the unforgiving wasteland, but he also saw the worst of humanity as the world descended into chaos. Karl's experiences made him realize that the strong had to protect the weak, and that to do so, he had to be ruthless.\nKarl joined the Reich early on, seeing it as the best way to ensure his own survival and to bring order to the world. He quickly climbed the ranks, using his intelligence and cunning to outmaneuver his rivals. He was ruthless in his pursuit of power, eliminating anyone who stood in his way. His loyalty to the Reich was absolute, and he saw himself as a defender of the Russian people against the chaos and anarchy of the wasteland."

His loyalty to the Reich was absolute, and he saw himself as a defender of the Russian people against the chaos and anarchy of the wasteland.\nAs a Gestapo agent, Karl was tasked with rooting out dissent and maintaining order in the Reich. He was feared and respected by his subordinates, who knew that any failure would result in swift punishment. Karl saw himself as a necessary evil, doing what needed to be done to ensure the survival of the Reich and its people. His reputation for brutality and efficiency earned him the nickname 'the Butcher.'\nDespite his loyalty to the Reich, Karl had his own ambitions. He saw himself as a future leader of the Reich, one who would bring order to the wasteland and restore humanity to its former glory. He was willing to do whatever it took to achieve that goal, even if it meant betraying his fellow Reich members.\nAs the years passed, Karl became more and more disillusioned with the Reich's leadership. He saw corruption and incompetence everywhere he looked, and he knew that the Reich was slowly rotting from within. Karl began to plan his own rise to power, biding his time and waiting for the right opportunity to strike. He knew that one day, he would be the one to lead the Reich into a new era of greatness."

  RCH_stortbeker_desc:0 "What seperates the disciplined order of the Reich, and the savage hordes of mutant beasts or communists is where their loyalty lies. Even to many amongst the ranks of the Reich, who spit phlegm and swear over his name being passed. Stortbeker is reknowned for his cunning aplitude and for his results. A craven and cruel commander who commands even more depraved soldiers than he is. Convicted criminals of the Reich, or punished former soldiers of the Metromacht sent to Stortbekers brigade and not expected to survive. Instead however Stortbeker has coddled, or rather sparked something far more insidious and wicked than what even the spoused dogma from the Propaganda Ministry could coin up."
