 trb_cloth_industry_desc:0 "Whilst being an otherwise insignificant and backwater station in the metro, Trubnayas primary profession is the repairing and stitching of old, worn-out clothing. Looms and other weaving machines line the side platforms of the station as seamstresses tire throughout the work-day to sew and restitch clothes of all sizes. Fit for common ordinary folk. Though better off not asking who was the previous wearer."
