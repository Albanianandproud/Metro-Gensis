 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Genesis"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "It has been 15 years since the day of Armageddon. On that fateful day humanity drew its last breath and casted itself into extinction. With the remnants taking refuge within the dark and dingy tunnels and systems which comprise the Moscow Metro. Cultivating its own law and governance within each station. While safe from the nuclear obliteration on the surface, the constant state of perpetual war, mutant infestations and now reports of an insidious menace stirring within the decrepit dakrness. Does Humanity have any hope of survival?"

 RED_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Occupying much of the Sokolnicheskaya Line. The Red Line is perhaps last bastion of Soviet nostalgia possibly in the entire world. It is the obstinate testament of Russias glorious Socialist past, housing the largest population in the entire metro of over 15,000 people. Once poised to engulf the entire metro in a furious tide of Communist Rule, infighting, betrayal and fatigue causing those dreams to collapse.\n\nThe resonating will of Lenin has not yet diminished as seen by its current leader. But vultures linger all around. Within and without. The Scars of the Hansa-Redline war have yet to heal, and won't be forgotten anytime soon.\n"
 
 MSU_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Nestled outside beyond the bounds of the Metro, is the Mythic Emerald City. Believed to be a cradle of old-world scientific knowledge and culture; far rivaling and exceeds anything of the likes from Polis. A bastion of peace and harmony in an otherwise ignorant and oblivious world. However what is truly known of their existance is little more than half-truths, incomplete rumours and tall tales from the bottom of a flask of liquor.\n\nBut just like the childrens book its name is derived from; its grandiose stature a mere fairy tale. A tenuous tale which is bound to crack."
 
 HNZ_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Hanza is the largest and most economically powerful faction in the Metro. A Capitalist Alliance of independant stations, which has completely subjugated the Ring Line. Lording economic and political hegemony throughout the inner, and outer metro lines. Despite its peaceful nature, it much prefers to stay neutral if not ignorant of conflict. Chosing economic sanctions over direct military actions.\n\n However this almighty status would have not been without conflict; The bloody and ruthless Hanza-Redline War in the 2020s, paying the bloodprice personally for the war. While peace was achieved, it did little to quell the flames, with tensions slowly, but surely stirring all across the Metro. A major conflict will come. With Hanza being at its epicenter. Whether they like to or not."
 
 RCH_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "§RRussia for the Russians!§! Originally established at Pushkinskaya, and formed from surviving pre-war nationalists and other far-right extremist groups. Who in turn looked into the to the grim and morbid history of the past as a means to endure and survive the present. Proclaiming themselves as the successors to Hitlers 3rd Reich, which once carved a bloody swathe across most of Europe. \n\n Recently unifying the neighbouring stations of Tverskaya and Chekhovskaya. The power of their current leader is now consolidated, and his rule unquestioned. As nuclear warheads obliterated the surface, they knew the real war had yet to begin. A war of total annihilation of all lesser peoples and the triump of theirs. Taking it on themselves to purge the Metro from all mutants and vile filth. The mutated, sick and ethnic-scum will be wiped from the earth. Reclusive, and repulsed by the denizens of the Metro. They are willing to die to secure their Thousand Year Reich."

 PLS_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Polis is a relatively young-state. Formed in the aftermath of the Hanza-Redline War. Most likely the last place on earth where people live like people. Where the spark of humanity has not yet snuffed out all together.\n\n Polis is a City State of 4 stations slap-bang in the epicentre of the Metro, consequently giving rise to its power. Not of war or industry, but as a sanctuary of scientific, artistic and musical knowledge. Those who are not able to fight, or the metro deems 'too inadequate' flock to Polis. Despite a being a 'life-boat' of knowledge in an otherwise ocean of ignorance, Polis keeps alive a perception of the world that many of its neighbours simply have forgotten. The world is ignorant of Polis, and so Polis is ignorant of the outside world. \n\n But as the gears of war slowly crank and turn, and beady eyes gaze upon its magnifience. The pen may be mightier than the sword, but it is no match for the barrel of a gun."

 SPT_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "§RIf not us then who?!§!\n\n An elite force of battle-hardened warriors belonging to no ideology or nation and only serve the presevation of humanity. The Spartans, like those from ancient history are the most skilled and deadliest soldiers in the whole metro. The protection and preservation of humanity against whatever threats are their sole duty. Many of its former members serving in Russian Special Forces before the war. Or those who have served in other special, elite forces across the globe. They maintain a close relationship with Polis and its defense, and keep a neutral stance towards the bigger factions of the Metro. But with war on the distant horizon, and mutants scowl and embolden; for how long can they remain idle for?"

 ARB_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Once having substantial power and a sizable population, the Arbat Confederation is little more than a vassal state to Hanza. Severely weakened during the Hanza-Redline conflict. Now with an unseen threat lingering in the shadows, its population stired up and fleeing the station."

 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Almost two-decades have cultivated various communities. All with their own seperate identities. Engaging in trade, diplomacy and warring amongst one another. Many of whom by and large are ignored by the bigger political turmoil. Only sharing one thing in common; survival. Struggling to meet ends in this decaying world."
 
 BAU_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "An Alliance of stations on the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line who prioritise in retrofitting and repairing pre-war technology. Relatively able to stay afloat and wealthy from their interactions with the rest of the metro. But with stirring threats and Hansa mobilising. How long can the Alliance sustain their neutrality?"

 GWC_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "The Metro clings onto semblance of order, but there are those who defy civilization entirely. Those who are no longer human, and neither mutant. Pale, gaunt and skeletal-like figures skulk in the dark recesses of the underground. Waiting, preying for their time to strike."

 KAL_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "A confederation of peaceful cooperating stations on the Kalininsko-Solntsevskaya line. A rather tranquil working community ruled by a overseeing council. With no threats of mutants, and only a few outright dangerous anomalies. The issue, like always comes from humans; as the confederation faces more scrutiny day by day. It wont be long before the people try and tear down the very same thing they helped establish"

 TRT_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Intersecting where 3 tunnel lines meet is the Bandit Triangle. A location of wealth and power, being partially flooded giving it the name of 'Venice' based upon a great city of Ages Past. Its a hive of scum and other dregs that the Metro habours. A city of sin, and of opportunity run by thugs and gangs. Organized crime hustles and schemes out in the open.\n\n Whilst Venice is unlike any other place in the Metro, a place free from the shackles of ideology or prudence. If the Bandit Triangle were to organize and appear as not just mere bandits. They could become a major new power within the metro, if not one to be respected."

 ULI_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "A left-leaning community occupying the northwestern section of the Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya line. It is becoming increasingly poor from economic decline, internal strife and mutant attacks. With Hanza closing in to swallow them hole, the confederation needs to stand firm strong one-by-one, or be blown away by the coming storm."

 SEV_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "A station of Engineers, but most predominantly soldiers. Every citizen trained to fight the mutants who skulk from the southern tunnels. It is an important station which provides power to most if not all of the Southern Metro."

 VDN_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "A peaceful trading community reknowned for their mushroom tea. Able to live quite comfortably through trade with its neighbours and partners from afar. Hosuing its own public library and with high rates of literacy."

 BRK_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "A collection of free farms and factories. Who are the 'breadbasket' of the Metro. Selling mushrooms, pigs and wheat which the communities stalkers discovered."

 SCA_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Ratmen, Mutants, Scaven. Describing the human-rat people. Once humans who became diseased and infected by a rat-infection which killed many, and only few survived but where disfigured in the process. Isolated away from the rest of the Metro the Commonwealth of Scaven Stations seeks nothing more than peaceful seculusion. Considered nothing more than mutants by other denizens of the Metro.  The Scaven despite what is often described as just mere mutants takes great strides within the preservation of humanity. Juxaposing their disposition with outsiders to their internal affairs. Whilst their human appearance has withered, their spirit and minds won't. As their former kinsmen rejected and shot them, and so the Scaven detested humans for it."

 ISL_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Inhabited by the Scaven. The Caliphate is inhabited by those of Caucasian lineages. The Caliphate is a slave-caste society based upon blood and purity. The lower castes of the Scaven are enslaved. Gridlocked in a constant conflict with the cackling 'kafir' of the south."

 SAT_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "As Heaven and Hell collided when nuclear armageddon struck the earth, it only made sense for those survivors to fall onto superstition. Some to God, and others to ancient deities long forgotten. But some called reverence upon the cruel and wicked.\n\n prowling and lurking within the once-abandoned station Timiryazevskaya. Believing that Hell has come to earth, and Moscow itself is a gate to the underworld. Its now alight with the cries of numerous captives, as the station is dotted with candles and marks of Satan himself."

 EUR_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Europe controls two stations of the Filyovskaya line (Mezhdunarodnaya and Vystavochnaya) and one station on the Kalininsko-Solntsevskaya line (Delovoy Tsentr). It has borders with the Arbat Confederation and the Great Worm Cult.\n\n
 A significant portion of the residents of Europe are immigrants, former businessmen and employees of the Moscow City business center. The Community is mostly cut off from the 'Big Metro' and so has more time to focus on themselves than the happenings of the Rest of the Metro. European residents often need this time as they are formed of immigrants of many different nations all over Europe and so have many cultural clashes."
