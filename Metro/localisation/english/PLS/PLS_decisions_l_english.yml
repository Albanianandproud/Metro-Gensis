  PLS_council_decision_category: "Committee of Polis"
  PLS_council_decision_category_desc: "Always grumbling and often cantankerous, the Council of Polis is where the majority of our edicts are codified into law, and poignant issues raised. The lives and futures of so many laying in the hands of so few. Delicately balancing the contentedness of the Council, and pursuing our political aims will be no easy feat."

  PLS_mission_dictatorial_1: "§lKshatriya§!: Build more Workshops!"
  PLS_mission_dictatorial_1_desc: "Our soldiers humbly request that we start constructing more military workstations. The Kshatriya aren't going to defend the tunnels with sticks now, are they?"
  PLS_mission_dictatorial_2: "§lKshatriya§!: Command Center"
  PLS_mission_dictatorial_2_desc: "Our Commanders and General Staff urge us to begin making preparatory plans for Polis' defence. This includes drawing up reservists amongst the fit population if truly necessary. We are the Bastion of Humanity, but that Law Degree isn't going to help dig the trench." 
  PLS_mission_dictatorial_3: "§lKshatriya§!: Commence War Exercises"
  PLS_mission_dictatorial_3_desc: "Polis may be a Neutral state, but that only exists on paper. Mutants, Fascists and those who just can't read aren't going to bother following regulations. We need to be prepared for conflict, if ever it arises."
  PLS_mission_dictatorial_4: "§lKshatriya§!: More War Exercises"
  PLS_mission_dictatorial_4_desc: "Perhaps the rest of the Metro are more illiterate than we previously thought. Our Soldiers are gathering together to conduct more training simulations. It'd be wise to give them as much equipment as we can."
  PLS_mission_council_1: "§iBrahmin§!: Research Grants"
  PLS_mission_council_1_desc: "Always tinkering, always pondering and always expecting more; The Brahmin are in a sordid spot. Human Progress hasn't stopped, in their eyes, but has staggered haphazardly onwards. If we expect Humanity to put men on the moon; or rather in this circumstance on the surface again they request more than meagre scraps to continue their research efforts."
  PLS_mission_council_2: "§iBrahmin§!: Research More and More!!"
  PLS_mission_council_2_desc: "Putting all our R&D efforts into the newest fad gun, or the latest fashioned killing machine mustn't come at the cost at neglecting Human decency. Polis might be the bastion of Civilization but most folks are still going weeks without bathing! Something has to be done about this and quick as possible."
  PLS_mission_council_3: "§iBrahmin§!: Conduct Surface Experiments"
  PLS_mission_council_3_desc: "The Surface isn't supposed to be habitable til the dawn of the next century, but our Brahmins aren't content with sitting on their asses. A whole new goldmine of Scientific knowledge lays on the surface; ripe for our pickings. Just gotta send one, two or a dozen poor unfortunate saps up there."
  PLS_mission_council_4: "§iBrahmin§!: Surface Experiments; Addendum"
  PLS_mission_council_4_desc: "The First round of experiments proved promising, but ultimately lacked the required expected yield in the eyes of our Scientists; their measure? More experiments must be concluded at this instant!"
  PLS_mission_community_1: "§yShudra§!: Civil Sectors"
  PLS_mission_community_1_desc: "Polis role is to safeguard and preserve Humanity. But we mustn't forget our humanity neither. Ignoring the needs of the people will only spur more disgruntlement."
  PLS_mission_community_2: "§yShudra§!: Rail transportation"
  PLS_mission_community_2_desc: "Rather than walking to and fro on foot, it would be much easier to haul resources through handcarts. Attempting to overhaul our logistic capacity to rely solely upon transportation is much needed."
  PLS_mission_community_3: "§yShudra§!: Build more Infrastructure"
  PLS_mission_community_3_desc: "Whilst our efforts to preserve the state of our Stations has been a largely successful task, more still could be done to improve them."
  PLS_mission_community_4: "§yShudra§!: Construction Renovations"
  PLS_mission_community_4_desc: "Polis may strive to continue Science and the Arts; but what of the people? Culture and Science alone isn't going to rekindle the flame that Humanity is still living. We mustn't neglect the needs or the concerns of our people. Lest we forget history, and let it repeat once more."
  PLS_mission_oligarch_1: "§hVaishya§!: Build more Civilian Workshops"
  PLS_mission_oligarch_1_desc: "Our available Civilian workshops are in a disheartening state. We should make an effort to improve our relations with the Vaishya caste, and construct more."  
  PLS_mission_oligarch_2: "§hVaishya§!: Economic Sufficiency"
  PLS_mission_oligarch_2_desc: "In the turbulent times of now, Polis must recognize that it cannot rely on any other power for support. The aloof Hanza, jingoist Redline and others may only keep the lights on for so long until they decide to barge down our door. Polis, more than ever must become self-sufficient."
  PLS_mission_oligarch_3: "§hVaishya§!: Build up [PLS.CAPITAL.GetName]"
  PLS_mission_oligarch_3_desc: "[PLS.CAPITAL.GetName] Shouldn't be neglected neither, like the old world which came before, it should resonate the indomitable human spirit upon the eyes of wayward travelers. That the light of humanity has not yet been snuffed. As long as Polis endures."
  PLS_mission_oligarch_4: "§hVaishya§!: Heart of the Metro"
  PLS_mission_oligarch_4_desc: "Nestled at the epicentre of the Metro; not only does Polis hold immense political power. With enough effort, backhand dealing and firm handshakes it could also be center of economic power. Nothing to rival the likes of the Hanza, but enough make the tunnels leading in and out of Polis to feel safe, and more importantly lively once more."


  PLS_surface_stalk_decisions: "Stalk the Surface"
  PLS_surface_stalk_decisions_desc: "As the saying goes; feed a man a fish, and he'll be fed for a day. However teach a man to fish, he'll be fed for a lifetime. Polis' mission aligns with proverb. Unlike our petty neighbours, we are not looking for guns or for things which'll get us only through the week. We are scouring for objects of great significance which'll last us for a lifetime."
