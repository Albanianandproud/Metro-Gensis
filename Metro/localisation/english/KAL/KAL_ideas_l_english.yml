Blending the tenets of Fourth Political Theory and Neo-Luddism into a new-age philosophy. The synthesis of §CLiberalism§!, §RMarxism§! and §gFascism§! with the rejection of «wicked» technology to create an underground utopia.\n\nPeople laugh and dismiss his nonsense quite rightly, but give the poor old man sympathy and move on. However eventually people will listen to his ideals. As the blunders and shortcomings of the Confederation appear this will undoubtedly be the case."
