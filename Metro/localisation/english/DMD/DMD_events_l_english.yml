 nf_DMD.1.t:0 "The State of Domodedovskaya"
 nf_DMD.1.d:0 "We control an alliance of three stations: Domodedovskaya, Orekhovo - allied with each other. Krasnogvardeyskaya serves as a guard post, defending against the mutants from the eastern tunnels and the personnel consisting only soldiers from Domodedovskaya. The main problem is the full isolation as there are no inhabited stations anywhere close, along the radiation as the stations located right under the surface. To add more problems, since Orekhovo's generator broke down, the stations only powered by a single generator from Domodedovskaya, which is not enough. Partially for this reason the stations are lit by torches, not lights. Orekhovo is producing potatoes and mushrooms, while Domodedovskaya pigs - exchanging with each other. There are no guards at north of Orekhovo, since Tsaritsyno is flooded and separated by hermetic gates..."
 nf_DMD.1.a:0 "We must hold up even if we are alone!"

 nf_DMD.2.t:0 "An unexpected detachment from Pechatniki"
 nf_DMD.2.d:0 "Today three stalkers arrived under the leadership  of Oleg Nemov. Pechatniki's station management picked up a radio signal from a survivor from Kaluga. And they made a plan, how to get there - an airship. So the management organized the expedition."
 nf_DMD.2.a:0 "An airship?"

 nf_DMD.3.t:0 "A sole survivor from the Biryulevo a military unit"
 nf_DMD.3.d:0 "Stalkers from Pechatniki saved a man on the surface who happened to be the last survivor of the Biryulevo a military unit. Sergei Wilder, a doctor who told the management there is an intact airship in a hangar there. However, years passed since then. Oleg Nemov knows where is the doctor: he lives alone at the tunnel between Krasnogvardeyskaya and Alma Atinskaya. He is needed as a guide to reach the military unit. Also, there is a possibility we can get parts to repair the generator in Orekhovo."
 nf_DMD.3.a:0 "Let's find him then."

 nf_DMD.4.t:0 "The doctor was found"
 nf_DMD.4.d:0 "Oleg Nemov was right, the doctor was there, though it was dangerous to get to the tunnel from Krasnogvardeyskaya as it was inhabited by a huge mutant frog spitting acid."
 nf_DMD.4.a:0 "Good, now set up the expedition to the military unit."

 nf_DMD.5.t:0 "The expedition returned back successfully"
 nf_DMD.5.d:0 "The expedition found the airship, along with stored helium in metal cylinders, although it needs some repair. Even more, the hangar has a connection to Metro-2 which happens to have a tunnel leads to a bomb shelter next to the Orekhovo station. Some people died and the doctor was found to be a traitor - he killed everybody at the military unit back then after an incident where he was stinged by something which turns him insane occasionally. He left a note of the incident in the military unit's bunker, so the whole story was found out. Apparently he died when he tried to escape from the expedition. But at the end the expedition found many things that can be salvaged from the rooms of the Metro-2."
 nf_DMD.5.a:0 "Great news! Send people for salvaging and to repair the ship!"

 nf_DMD.6.t:0 "The salvaging teams found spare parts for the generator"
 nf_DMD.6.d:0 "The day after returning, the first caravan was equipped and returned with spare parts for the broken diesel generator. From that moment on, the station has electric lighting again. Life gradually improved for the Orekhovo residents, they acquired equipment for sorties, weapons and ammunition. Caravans connected the military unit with the stations. Smiles could be seen more often on people's faces. Success inspired them, life became at least a little easier. Now it is possible to expand the farms thanks to electricity, put the station and utility rooms in order."
 nf_DMD.6.a:0 "Amazing, focus on salvaging"
 nf_DMD.6.b:0 "Amazing, now think about the defence of the stations"

 nf_DMD.7.t:0 "Disaster in Orekhovo"
 nf_DMD.7.d:0 "We don't know what happened exactly, but we heard a rumble and death screams from Orekhovo. We immediately called reinforcements from Krasnogvardeyskaya until we found out it is probably over. A big flood was coming from the tunnels of Orekhovo which brought a lot aquatic mutants to Domodedovskaya. We immediately started to evacuate women and children to Krasnogvardeyskaya and defend from the incoming flood, however our situation seems unsustainable. What should we do?"
 nf_DMD.7.a:0 "Evacuate our stations immediately towards the surface, we must try to reach Pechatniki! (game will end for you)"
 nf_DMD.7.b:0 "We must hold Domodedovskaya, wait for the reinforcements from Krasnogvardeyskaya!"

 nf_DMD.8.t:0 "Sabotage attempt in Orekhovo"
 nf_DMD.8.d:0 "There was an attempt to destroy the hermetic gates between Tsaritsyno and Orekhovo. The newly set up guards and defences averted the disaster, but raising a question how somebody could get there as it must arrived from Tsaritsyno. Either way, the hermetic gates are repaired, and now it can be used to have an access to Tsaritsyno."
 nf_DMD.8.a:0 "Thank God! Now continue the salvaging from Metro-2 and the military unit."
