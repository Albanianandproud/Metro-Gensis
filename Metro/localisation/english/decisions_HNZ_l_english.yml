 HNZ_pressure_reich_open_trade_desc:0 "The Reich sits upon untold amounts of pre-war technology, not to mention they are a self-sustaining isolationist economy with very little interaction with the outside world. Their military is unmatched, but at a constant knifes edge with the Red Line, they'll have to make the difficult choice to either submit to our demands, or be caught making enemies with both of the major superpowers."

 HNZ_reich_treaty_desc:0 "It is no surprise the Reich dreams of expansion, sitting in their fortress station they plan and draw up aspirations of lebensraum. What if we gave them passage? Demand they will keep well away from Polis and our sphere of influence, and in return let them take a little slice of the Metro for their Reich. They would provide excellent trade partners... and an even better ally against the Mobilising Red Line!"
