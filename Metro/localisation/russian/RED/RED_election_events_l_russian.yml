 nf_RED_election_system.2.d:0 "It appears that that Moskvin, the brother to general secretary, seeks to run for General Secretary of the Red Line. A relatively new face to appear amongst the higher crust of the Red Line political party. He had grown a reputation amongst the younger members of the komsomol, especially within the Military. His actions against the diminished Junta propelling his newfound political career. However considering now it is very much brother pitted against brother, it is uncertain whether the sibling bond between the two will rot away."

 nf_RED_election_system.3.d:0 "It appears as though Maxim and Andrey have fallen out. Following a heated debate prolongued over the course of several hours. The two clashed inside Andrey's office. The two argued long into the night over policies and the future regarding the Red Line. Although the semantics of the moment raged, it was obviously clear the dialogue meandered from politics to bitter resentment between the two. Vehemence beyond words erupted between the two leaving Moskvin enraged and who left the office in a furious storm. Since then the two have yet to meet and discuss like they had used to. Regardless of whether Maxim was running out of spite, or from own aspirations, it now seems he is determined to best his brother in the ballot box."
