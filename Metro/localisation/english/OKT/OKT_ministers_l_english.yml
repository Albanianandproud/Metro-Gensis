  OKT_leander_nekrasov: "Leander Nekrasov"
  OKT_NEKRASOV_DESC: "When you hold the most steady hand and even more accurate shot amongst the security team most give their respect. Having been de-jure administrator of Oktyabrskaya even since orchestrating the defence of the station against Tretyakov raids, a sense of normalcy exists at Oktyabrskaya, thanks in no part to Nekrasovs strong commitment to maintaining order at whatever cost. Though constant vigilance is always placed on the tunnel leading to the Tretyakov triangle, more men than mutant make their excursions from there week by week."
  OKT_oleg_sorokin: "Oleg Sorokin"
  OKT_SOROKIN_DESC: "Being a professional freelance shooter tends to have its perks. Perhaps being able to shoot a gun possesses few administrative qualities, but when problems have inevitably been brought to him, Sorokin has found himself to have a knack for de-escalation. With dozen notches to his name, nobody has yet to go against his word or his orders."
