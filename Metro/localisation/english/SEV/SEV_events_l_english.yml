 nf_SEV.1.t:0 "The State of the Sevastopolskaya Hydroelectric Power Plant"
 nf_SEV.1.d:0 "Sevastopolskaya HPP lays on a double station: Sevastopolskaya and Kakhovskaya. It possess several hydroelectric turbines which use groundwater to generate electricity. It is one of the most important power sources in the Moscow Metro, supplying the entire southern half of Hanza with electricity. Sevastopolskaya is often attacked by mutants, usually coming from the southern tunnels, but sometimes also from north. Also being fully dependent on ammunition from Hanza, which is the only way to hold the mutant attacks."
 nf_SEV.1.a:0 "We must defend ourself until our last breath!"

 nf_SEV.2.t: "Missing caravan"
 nf_SEV.2.d: "The caravan we sent to trade at Serpukhovskaya went missing since days. This long delay didn't happen us with yet. Something must happened with them on their way. The telephone connection with the Hanza doesn't work since Monday. Without the ammunition they would brought back, we can't hold up against the mutants more than 1,5-2 weeks. After that we must close our southern gates, but 2/3 of our generators are there. We won't be able to sene electricity to the Hanza and we can only rely on our self-sufficiency."
 nf_SEV.2.a: "Send a troika to check the caravan"

 nf_SEV.3.t: "The troika returns"
 nf_SEV.3.d: "The troika we sent to find out what happened returned with bad news. The hermetic door at Tulskaya was closed. We are cut from the Hanza now. After an emergency meeting the only decision remained to send two people in hazmat suits that we have to gp towards Kashirskaya and attempt to reach Hanza through the Zamoskvoretskaya line, then reach Tulskaya and open the gates. If they don't succeed we can try to reach Tulskaya from the surface or close our southern gates and give up the connection with the Metro."
 nf_SEV.3.a: "Let's hope they will succeed"

 nf_SEV.4.t: "We don't have any news from our people"
 nf_SEV.4.d: "Days passed since we sent them to the eastern tunnels. They may died or stuck in the metro. Whatever is the reason, we can't wait. We must send an assault squad to Tulskaya with subversives on the surface to open the hermetic doors."
 nf_SEV.4.a: "They are our last hope"

 nf_SEV.5.t: "The assault squad returns"
 nf_SEV.5.d: "The assault squad returned without able to finish their task. Tul'skaya is dead, the whole station was burnt. Probably nobody survived. What could happened?"
 nf_SEV.5.a: "We need to restore the contact with the Hanza"

 nf_SEV.6.t: "Contact restored"
 nf_SEV.6.d: "We managed to restore the phone connection with Hanza, however, we didn't get an explanation from the station leader of Dobryninskaya. However there are rumours about an armour train with unmarked soldiers going to Tulskaya and arriving back."
 nf_SEV.6.a: "Perhaps we will never find out the truth"

 nf_SEV.7.t: "The depot of the Kakhovskaya line"
 nf_SEV.7.d: "The entrance of the depot from the tunnel is welded with metal rods with a sign of a skull. Definitely it means that can be dangerous. Regardless we must find out what is there."
 nf_SEV.7.a: "Remove the barricade!"

 nf_SEV.8.t: "Mutants in the Depot"
 nf_SEV.8.d: "The metal barricade was cut open to reveal what was behind. Beyond the absolute void lay nothing. Then a hundred tiny beady white eyes pierced the darkness. There was a reason why the entrance was closed. Today we received a grim reminder of why so."
 nf_SEV.8.a: "Damn!"

 nf_SEV.9.t: "Nothing of Value"
 nf_SEV.9.d: "The metal barricade was cut open to reveal what was behind. Beyond the absolute void lay nothing. The depot seems to be abandoned since a long time ago. Whatever was the danger it isn't there anymore. And all what we can use is just a bunch of scrap."
 nf_SEV.9.a: "Well then"

 nf_SEV.10.t: "A cache of rare materials"
 nf_SEV.10.d: "The metal barricade was cut open to reveal what was behind. Beyond the absolute void lay nothing. The depot seems to be abandoned since a long time ago. Whatever was the danger it isn't there anymore. But we found a lot useful metal equipments."
 nf_SEV.10.a: "Amazing"

 nf_SEV.11.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] seeks to join the [Root.GetFactionName]"
 nf_SEV.11.d:0 "In the face of increasing threats to liberty and democratic values, the [alliance_applicant.GetAdjective] look to us as the defenders of freedom. They now wish to be admitted into our alliance, both to enjoy our protection and to stand with us against the forces that would threaten democracy."
 nf_SEV.11.a:0 "All who stand for liberty and democracy may stand with us."
 nf_SEV.11.b:0 "We are better off without them."
