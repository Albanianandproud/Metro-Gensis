 nf_SPT.1.t:0 "Resource Shortages"
 nf_SPT.1.d:0 "Hello Colonel Sir. As you currently know our current operations lay outside the jurisdiction of Polis. Whilst we may rely on their political support, we are in dire need of resources. Our technicians require many pieces of tooling which our new base of operation simply lacks. Polis' council assistance with resources is doubtful, and our military feels the squeeze from the lack of equipment. They won't hide their discontent for much longer. Whilst we may trade for required resources with Hansa or Arbat, a much ideal solution is to trek out onto the surface and find them ourselves. We are the Rangers, we should not be tethered to one polity for support.\n\nWe have found several key locations which are a great place to begin salvaging efforts. I hope you trust our plan, Colonel sir."
 nf_SPT.1.a:0 "It is a good plan indeed"

 nf_SPT.2.t:0 "Salvaging Operations: Addendum"
 nf_SPT.2.d:0 "Even though the voyage to the surface was difficult and by no means an easy feat, our Spartans were successful in their mission. They key sites we had initially planned to salvage from remained initially intact. Other than erosion from weather and debris they were left untouched. We'll be able to set up a rudmientary outpost in this spot for the meantime, and carry resources back and to our station. This should surely help ameliorate our resource shortages."
 nf_SPT.2.a:0 "A boon to our production, but we need more resources"
 nf_SPT.2.b:0 "A decent salvage, but still lacking"
 nf_SPT.2.c:0 "Our stores are full; that should be enough resources for the meantime."
