 GWC_worm_military_1: "Warriors Call"
 GWC_worm_military_1_desc: "There are few amongst our flock who could best the Warrior in combat. Its unknown where about he came from, with some believing he was brought to us by the Great Worm himself. Only Priest, and Warrior himself know and they seldom seek to tell. Neither man, wicked or sacred has ever found themselves crossed in his maddening ire, and lived to tell the tale."

 GWC_worm_military_2: "Doped Shrooms"
 GWC_worm_military_2_desc: "The mushrooms which grow within our tunnel networks retain peculiar properties. Whilst looking withered and decaying, they possess hypnotic, almost magical properties. People who have eaten them describe seeing vivid images and hearing loud, almost deafening voices. May it be a direct communication link to the Worm himself? Preist believes not, however our warriors are adament upon ingesting these mushrooms before going into battle. As they believe the imagery may predict future outcomes of battles to be, and to come."

 GWC_worm_military_6: "Primal Fury"
 GWC_worm_military_6_desc: "In its core form, all of our Worshippers carry with them the words of the Worm itself. A hatred of the non-believers and a fury to ruin the decadent civilization which tumors the metro. The house of the worm."

 GWC_worm_military_7: "A Culture of Conflict"
 GWC_worm_military_7_desc: "Humanity has, and always will be a society built solely upon the bones and carcass of itself. No other being is able to wage war as complete and as effective as man. No where is that evident than WW3, plunging humanities domain into a bath of eternal damnation and fire. But we aren't humanity, nor are we beast. We are more than that."

 GWC_worm_military_10: "Deadly Crafts"
 GWC_worm_military_10_desc: "Unorthodox compared to the technology of the sinners. Our tools are sickly and crude. Effective and Dangerous. Their rifles stand no chance against the swift swing of a sharp blade, or falling wind from a Adze head."

 GWC_worm_military_armaments_1: "Weapon Crafts"
 GWC_worm_military_armaments_1_desc: "Despite what Priest has taught, that the production of technology always leads to war and destruction. He has allowed for the limited production of crafts and tools such as blowpipes and clubs."

 GWC_worm_military_armaments_2: "Armament Production"
 GWC_worm_military_armaments_2_desc: "Rudimentary tools and blowpipes are permitted to be produced, oversaw by Priest. Our warriors in the field, or the depths are to be equipped, incase they catch themselves out against heretical forces."

 GWC_focus_1_desc: "It is a time of great change, our leader looks afar towards the rest of the underground. Humanity has not yet ridden itself of their sins. Only through holy baptism by word of the Worm can salvation be given. However they grasp onto the fading memory of the old world by the usage of technology. Only through our word can we relieve them, and ourselves from ignorance."

 GWC_supremacy_of_force_desc: "The Wicked non-believers clutch onto technology, believing that it gives them strength - how unfortunate. Our strength is by magnitudes greater than any piece of frivolous technology could compare! Ours comes from our tenacity and our might. Coddled by technology which makes them weak, and ripe for destruction."

 GWC_heart_of_darkness_desc:0 "Park Pobedy looks nothing like what it did before WW3. Now, drapped in the remains and balefires of an orthodox way completely alien and heretical to civilization itself. Here lies the death and destruction of humanity, and the manifest resurgance of the Worm Worshippers. A grim birth of humanities demise."

 GWC_rid_the_machines:0 "Rid the Machines"
 GWC_rid_the_machines_desc:0 "The very same machines and pieces of technology are heretical to carry within the Worm Cult society, and must be trashed and destroyed.

 GWC_scarier_stakes:0 "Scarier Stakes"
 GWC_scarier_stakes_desc:0 "Ditches and spikes entrenched into the earth don't make for impending doom. But decorated with the rotting, mutilated corpses of those who-would tresspass? They'll think twice before entering our domain."

 GWC_ind_3:0 "Paleolithic Production"
 GWC_ind_3_desc:0 "Surprisingly, the production of stone tools is rather intricate. You can't just pick up any stone or rock and, despite its potential to be used to bash an unsuspecting foes cranium into mush. Certain rocks have natural characteristics which ties well into their usages."

 GWC_ind_4:0 "Toolmaking Industry"
 GWC_ind_4_desc:0 "Using a larger, more durable stone and using it to chip away at another smaller piece of rock through flaking off pieces is rather effective at producing bladed tips."

 GWC_ind_5:0 "Extending the Reach"
 GWC_ind_5_desc:0 "As our beating heart expands ever more so, we will innevitably come in contact with other peoples. We must make sure they know they are treading into our domain. Spike traps, effigies and stakes will make them think twice about coming further."

 GWC_toolmaking_smiths:0 "Toolmaking Culture"

 GWC_ind_6:0 "Neolithic Manufacturing"

 GWC_mil_3:0 "Bone Cudgels"
 GWC_mil_3_desc:0 "Stones and boulders are heavy. That is not difficult to notice how cumbersome it is to wield our stone tools. Bones however? They are easy and lightweight; much easier to craft and fashion too."

 GWC_mil_4:0 "Grizzly Adornments"
 GWC_mil_4_desc:0 "Sacred trinkets from our fallen enemies attatched to the weapons of our finest warriors will be a boon to the favour of the Great Worm. Trophies of the hunt and from the fallen enemies will in turn improve the lethality of our tools."
