 reclamation_event.4.t: "Colonization of Fili Depot"
 reclamation_event.4.d.a: "As our suspicions were confirmed, the Fili Depot was inhabited not by mutants, as our team of stalkers had predicted, but by people. And very perceptive people. When, after a tense standoff that almost escalated into a shootout, the hostilities between our group of stalkers and the locals ceased, the residents of the Depot finally trusted our team, providing them with enough food and water.\n\nThe former residents of Park Pobedy abandoned the station before the tunnel between their station and Kievskaya collapsed, as the situation was becoming increasingly dire. They decided to take their chances and venture deeper into the metro rather than be caught in the general chaos and disarray that reigned in the remnants. Finding this Depot to hide in and scouring the nearby tunnels for valuable resources, the few remaining became stalkers, scavenging resources on the surface. For a time, their situation was dire but bearable, even with a working water purifier and the ability to cultivate some of the mushrooms growing in the tunnels as a meager supply of food. Bargaining with any nearby forays to the surface. Their leader, who had led the group out of Park Pobedy and settled them in the Fili Depot, had mysteriously disappeared a few weeks earlier. They were forced to resort to extreme measures, as they began to suffer from malnutrition. Until they encountered our team."
 reclamation_event.4.d.b: "As our suspicions were confirmed, the Fili Depot was inhabited. Not by mutants, as our team of stalkers had predicted, but as a matter of fact humans who have began to open fire upon our sorties with strange firearms. As to be considered, concerning their pitiful disposition."
 reclamation_event.4.a: "We'll allow them in with open Arms!"
 reclamation_event.4.b: "To Arms!"

 scavenge_mission.1.t:0 "Scavengers Return Successfully"
 scavenge_mission.1.d:0 "The Scavenging mission was a success. Our Stalkers have returned with goods and equipment brought back from the surface. On top of that they recall discovering 3 distinct spots within the ruins of Moscow we can send further expeditions to. However they believe, considering the caustic nature of the surface most of the discoveries will be picked bare or waypoints scuffled by the turbulent weather. We may only chose one of these 3 points of interest to further send an expedition to."
