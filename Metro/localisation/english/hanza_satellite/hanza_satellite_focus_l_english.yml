 hanza_satellite_1: "With Neighbors like Ours"
 hanza_satellite_1_desc: "The Radial stations of the ring - the first roadblock to the rich underbelly of the Hanza and the big Metro. Merchants from all over gather to these stations, attracting wares and goods from all corners. Perhaps by no means as 'prosperous' as the shuttle stations of the Ring, but life moves on. It always could be worse."
 hanza_satellite_2: "The Frontier Markets"
 hanza_satellite_2_desc: "More than what the Commonwealth would like to let on, the radial stations act as arties supplying the flow of goods straight into the Ring. From everyday goods, station produce and most importantly of all armaments, can easily be found being peddled at the market stalls."
 hanza_satellite_3: "Stocking the Garrison"
 hanza_satellite_3_desc: "If denizens of the Big Metro would like you to believe, our stations aren't bastions of civilization on the hinterlands. Nor are the 'Barbarians' anything but promising trading partners. Incursions happen, just like any other station fear of mutant attacks are always present. Perhaps a little more than usual."
 hanza_satellite_4: "Bandit Hunting"
 hanza_satellite_4_desc: "More than anything, its humans which pose the greatest danger. Who would've thought where theres milk theres always those looking to skim a little off the top?"
 hanza_satellite_5: "Hub of Opportunity"
 hanza_satellite_5_desc: "Not just goods, but even people flow through our stations. Enticed with seeking better lives, or work elseplace. Even the sight of incandescent lamps is a new or sore sight for many.. Perhaps a little too sore for their eyes."
 hanza_satellite_5_A: "Netural Ground"
 hanza_satellite_5_A_desc: "Sometimes, when the temperature is too heated for opposing parties to negotiate at Polis or Belorusskaya, they may come to our station. From simple cases of caravan disputes to tense debates which could swing violent from the drop of a pin, or a misunderstanding."
 hanza_satellite_6: "Committment to the Hanza"
 hanza_satellite_6_desc: "The Radial stations are considered appendages of the Hanza for a reason. While the General Manager tends to other business, efforts are still made to exert control and influence over our station. Protection always comes at a cost."
 hanza_satellite_5_B: "Disreputable Visitors"
 hanza_satellite_5_B_desc: "Thugs, lowlife scum and bandits are barred from station entry, if not immediately shot on sight. Thats the memo on most Hanza checkpoints.. keyword on most. For a fixed price you might see disreptuable guards looking the other way; if they're in a good mood."
 hanza_satellite_7: "Economic Exchange"
 hanza_satellite_7_desc: "Trade can always prove to be lucrative, and promising to those with a good eye for it. A coat for 200 bullets. A pack of cigarettes for 60.. And if you look hard enough perhaps even a fabled stalker to risk life and limb to venture onto the surface."
 hanza_satellite_8: "Organzing the Workforce"
 hanza_satellite_8_desc: "New Pigsties, Mushroom plantations and Housing are constructed on the daily to compensate for the ever swelling population. Gangs of spare workforce are always on hand, for a price."
 hanza_satellite_8_A: "Arms Trades"
 hanza_satellite_8_A_desc: "Not to step on the toes of the Hanza, armament trading is rather rare.. Atleast more pristine than a duct-taped rifle. But sometimes though, you might find a lucrative offer."
 hanza_satellite_9: "Process the Immigrants"
 hanza_satellite_9_desc: "No Passport - No Entry. At least, thats the official statement. Sometimes guards can be persuaded to make exceptions. But for the majority, being processed is an arduous affair. That if, they're even worth the effort in the firstplace."
 hanza_satellite_9_A: "Bullets.. Bullets BULLETS"
 hanza_satellite_9_A_desc: "A well armed society is a polite society."
 hanza_satellite_10: "The Trade Must Flow"
 hanza_satellite_10_desc: "People wouldn't of survived living meek sedentary lives in station gutters. Trade must continue, because trade itself is vital for our continued existence. Whoever controls the trade, controls the power."
 hanza_satellite_11: "If You Build it.."
 hanza_satellite_11_desc: "Our prosperity is tied directly to the flow of caravans, but we can't always be sure they'll have a warm welcoming. A spare cot, a place to drink and sit and perhaps something warm to eat goes a long way for a welcoming experience."
 hanza_satellite_12: "The Hanza Approach"
 hanza_satellite_12_desc: "We live on pristine tracks, and neighbouring the Hanseatic League has more positive effects than negatives. As long as we keep our station well fortified, and well maintained then traders will come. Surely."
 hanza_satellite_13: "Proper Station Planning"
 hanza_satellite_13_desc: "We'll put the Pigsty besides the Workers Lodges, and we'll put the Administrators tent near to the pubhouse.."
 hanza_satellite_14: "From the Barrel"
 hanza_satellite_14_desc: "With wealth, comes power. And power comes from the barrel of a gun. Theres a reason why nobody yet has tried stepping on the Hanzas turf, unless they want to be blown to smithereens.. Or have half their station population battering down the gates because the Hanza stopped the food ships."
 hanza_satellite_15: "Embodiment of Capital"
 hanza_satellite_15_desc: "In the land hand 'Snickers' in the Right hand 'Mars', My PR manager is Karl Marx."
 hanza_satellite_16: "Pursuit of Profits"
 hanza_satellite_16_desc: "One bullet for you... One for me. Two for the station guards... One for me. One for the shestyorka who keeps the raiders from our caravans... And one for me."
 hanza_satellite_17: "To Live with A Song"
 hanza_satellite_17_desc: "Sometimes living is the one thing you can only do when enduring hard times. Hard times may never pass, but it doesn't mean you have to admit defeat. Despite all the difficulties, we live another day."
 hanza_satellite_18: "Rouse the Population"
 hanza_satellite_18_desc: "Theres always justification as to why there are so many guards hanging around, but incase of emergencies we can always draw from the population itself. Mobilization will be a hard pill to swallow; but either that or having half the station burning most will gladly take a rifle." 
 hanza_satellite_19: "Planning a Military Staff"
 hanza_satellite_19_desc: "Sure our soldiers might be able to line up and carry out orders in their own time. But we need proper command to straighten them from a rag-tad squad of guards into a proper competent fighting force."
 hanza_satellite_20: "Joint-Defense from The Hanza"
 hanza_satellite_20_desc: "Whilst the League doesn't yet claim direct control over our station, and are currently content with collecting their dear duties on passing goods; They have to keep up with their end of the bargain. Obviously they're not going to fit our militia with Kalashnikovs and Rocket launchers, maybe not even a few spare rifles. But at the very least they can lend us a few commanders to help bolster our defense."
 hanza_satellite_21: "Training Exercises"
 hanza_satellite_21_desc: "Try to get half-starved, half-awake soldiers to start doing jumping jacks and you'll be strung up by the Hermetic Gate. But give a carrot, instead of the crack of a whip in hopes of extra rations and less gristle in their stew.. ..Oh how they'll wish that they didn't skip gym class now."
 hanza_satellite_22: "'Shoot First' Approach"
 hanza_satellite_22_desc: "Shoot first, ask questions later. If they shoot back, well they weren't being civil to begin with were they?"
 hanza_satellite_23: "Purchase from 'Private' Vendors"
 hanza_satellite_23_desc: "Oh yes, our guns are very good! Just be careful to not pull the trigger too hard, or hold the handguard too tightly.. or touch the dust cover."
 hanza_satellite_24: "Bulwark Station"
 hanza_satellite_24_tooltip: "Enables Decisions to send trade caravans to neighbouring friendly stations"
 hanza_satellite_24_desc: "Against the horrors of the night and of the dark our station will be made into a bulwark; a perimeter defense of the last vestiges of civilization in Moscow."
 hanza_satellite_25: "Commercial Station"
 hanza_satellite_25_desc: "The seeds of a bustling community will be established. Not only trade, but the flow of gossip, news and culture shall flow from our Station in due time."
 hanza_satellite_26: "Trade Station"
 hanza_satellite_26_desc: "Leveraging control over the flow of trade, and ensuring the Hanza gets its cut, our station will surely grow into a bustling market."
 hanza_satellite_26_A: "Reducing Unemployment"
 hanza_satellite_26_A_desc: "With a crack of a whip, and fear of being kicked from the station the slobs and no-do-gooders will be forced into employment. Remember.. no slacking!"

 hanza_satellite_26_C_desc: "Working vice, measuring tape and files can be all yours for the hour.. for a price."
 hanza_satellite_26_D: "Influx of Labour"
 hanza_satellite_26_D_desc: "Like most of the time, people use our station as a temporary jettison to launch to places deep inside the Big Metro, seeking work or a chance for a better life. But why not at [ROOT.Capital.GetName]? Theres always opportunity for those who seek it. Besides, perhaps their passport gets denied, or their transfer documents mysteriously go missing?"
 hanza_satellite_26_E: "Reubrished Arms"
 hanza_satellite_26_E_desc: "Improvised guns are always relatively easy to come by, cannibalized from other firearms. They might seem simple, rugged but at the very least you get what you paid for."
 hanza_satellite_26_F: "Happy Hunting, Stalkers"
 hanza_satellite_26_F_desc: "Sometimes even wayward Stalkers make our station their temporary home, seeking to peddle what few but dearly important wares they've picked from the surface. They might even stick around, if our offer proves lucrative."
 hanza_satellite_27: "Repurposed Concrete"
 hanza_satellite_27_desc: "Finding bags of unspoiled, airtight concrete is close to impossible. However, we may scavenge concrete rubble to be reused and recycled and used as construction material."
 hanza_satellite_28: "Dismantling Crews"
 hanza_satellite_28_desc: "A much of the treasure troves of scrap has already been picked clean, specialized crews are needed to safely dismantle structures and extract machinery parts from wrecked structures."
 hanza_satellite_29: "Electronic Recycling"
 hanza_satellite_29_desc: "Delicate hands are needed for finer components, such as electronic boards. We can't have any monkey ripping apart a processor, or flux capacitor.. Unless they want to pay for the damage from their stipend."
 hanza_satellite_30: "Repaired Gasifier"
 hanza_satellite_30_desc: "Its bulky, stinks like shit and stains your clothes. But would you rather the nail-biting cold, or a bit of soot?"
 hanza_satellite_31: "Cement Mixers"
 hanza_satellite_31_desc: "Extraordinary rare, these machines are fiercely bought and haggled for, proving to be extremely critical to fashion good, durable structures."
 hanza_satellite_32: "Scrap Yards"
 hanza_satellite_32_desc: "Scavenger crews and diggers rip apart rusting carriages, devouring whole pieces of rusted machinery to paw at their metallic intestines. Oh how we oh so love copper wiring..."
 hanza_satellite_33: "Kept Specialists"
 hanza_satellite_33_desc: "You might get the occassional past braniac living in reclusivity. Mostly, they've long departed to Polis by now. With some convincing, they might even put aside their nihilistic mumblings and put their fading knowledge into action."
 hanza_satellite_34: "Improvised Fuels"
 hanza_satellite_34_desc: "The vast majority of gasoline had turned to varnish years ago, making it impossible to be used as fuel. Occassionally you might stumble across the rare trader selling gasoline cans scoured from parts unknown. But for the most part people will have to make do with hand-cranked or old coa-powered generators."
 hanza_satellite_34_A: "Concentrating Knowledge"
 hanza_satellite_34_A_desc: "Hoards of books, technical documents and practical texts are vital for retaining any semblance of knowledge of the old world. Its any surprise how they haven't been burned as fuel thus far.. Teach a man to fish.."
 hanza_satellite_34_B: "Saws and Boards"
 hanza_satellite_34_B_desc: "Woodworking isn't fading from memory that easily. Don't throw away the sawdust, fancy sawdust soup?"
 hanza_satellite_34_C: "Hand-Salvaging"

 hanza_satellite_34_F: "Food preservation"
 hanza_satellite_34_F_desc: "Some far-out stations have developed a primited method of food preservation during the long winter months. Smoking, pickling and fermenting. Some even retain the ability to can ingredients alltogether. Just be wary of bulged cans, theres always a savvy trader looking to swindle an unsuspecting sucker."
 hanza_satellite_34_G: "Scavenged Anvils"
 hanza_satellite_34_G_desc: "Strike when the hammer is hot!"

 hanza_satellite_36: "Taking in Technicians"

 hanza_satellite_37_desc: "The Hanza always seeks to grow, and even our meagre station has attracted the Eagles envious eye. Perhaps the greatest gift to some, or the worst fear to others has arrived. The Hanza seeks to integrate our station into the Commonwealth, meaning we have a spot amongst the league. The benefits are undoubtedly a net boon, but with it our autonomy will be forfeited."
 hanza_satellite_38: "Conscript Reservists"
 hanza_satellite_38_desc: "Where trade flows, so do those who just like parasites seek to feed and gouge themselves. We might not always be reliable in keeping bandits and mutants from attacking caravans. But an effort must be made to keep them far from the gates."

 hanza_satellite_44: "Heavy Bastard Guns"
 hanza_satellite_44_desc: "For all its drawbacks of this gunsmith's nightmare, its a rather decent weapon. Its versatility and ability to be customized should not be underestimated."
 hanza_satellite_45: "Standardized Gear"
 hanza_satellite_45_desc: "Sure, we're not going to find several-dozen exact identical padded coats and helmets just conviently in storage, but at the very least we can be sure our soldiers have atleast a pair of socks or soles on their boots."

Nothing comes in, or out without the acknowledgement of the Hanza."
 hanza_satellite_51: "Our Place lays Here"
 hanza_satellite_51_desc: "For autonomy, we must sacrifice for security and stability. It doesn't always have to be bad. As long as the Hanza recieves its pay, and we stop any old dreg from waltzing through the checkpoing we are more or less left to our own devises."
