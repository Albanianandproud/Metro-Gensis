 BM_HISTORY_TITLE:0 "Brief History"
 2028_NAME:0 "Genesis"
 2028_DESC:0 "It has been 15 years since the day of Armageddon. On that fateful day humanity drew its last breath and casted itself into extinction. With the remnants taking refuge within the dark and dingy tunnels and systems which comprise the Moscow Metro. Cultivating its own law and governance within each station. While safe from the nuclear obliteration on the surface, the constant state of perpetual war, mutant infestations and now reports of an insidious menace stirring within the decrepit dakrness. Does Humanity have any hope of survival?"

 RED_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "§R...And this line, once Sokolnicheskaya, but in the masses called "Red" - it was then customary for Muscovites to call all the branches among themselves by the color indicated on the metro map - quite officially became the Red Line.\n\n§!Occupying much of the Sokol Line. The Red Line is perhaps the last bastion of Soviet nostalgia possibly in the entire world. The obstinate testament of Russias glorious Socialist past. Every wall detailed and edifice exhumed a legacy of magnificence. Consecrated pilgramages from despondent mucovites to pay their dues to worn-statues and decaying mosaics.\n\nNostalgia soon turned to reverence as the notion to resurrect the Soviet Union quickly flared up across the Line. Surviving Komsomol members, old party officials and permanent members of the Proletariat pulled together as one unified committee to direct and order the firebrand of the revolution. Individual stations overthrowing their administrations and self-proclaiming the rebirth of the Soviet Union. Upheaval was bloodless, as the restoration and justice moved much of the starving inhabitants into obedience\n\nNow housing a population of over 15,000 people, Once poised to engulf the rest of the metro under the flames of revolution, infighting, fatigue betrayal causing those dreams to collapse.\n\nThe resonating will of Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov has not yet ceased as seen by its current leader; but wolves linger all around within the party and without. The scars of the Hansa-Redline war have yet to heal, and the legacy of the Socialist Soviet Union won't be forgotten anytime soon.\n"

 MSU_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "§R...But Yakov Iosifovich said that, they say, the University did not die. That they managed to block the tunnels, and now there are still people there§!\n\nNestled outside beyond the bounds of the Metro, is the Mythic Emerald City. Believed to be a cradle of old-world scientific knowledge and culture; far rivaling and exceeds anything of the likes from Polis. A bastion of peace and harmony in an otherwise ignorant and oblivious world. However what is truly known of their existance is little more than half-truths, incomplete rumours and tall tales from the bottom of a flask of liquor.\n\nBut just like the childrens book its name is derived from; its grandiose stature a mere fairy tale. A tenuous tale which is bound to crack."
 
 HNZ_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "§R...The Hanseatic League was the name of the Concord of Ring Line Stations. These stations were located at the intersection of all the other lines, and, therefore of all the trade routes. Which became a meeting place for businessmen from all over the metro. These businessmen grew rich with fantastic speed, and soon, knowing their wealth was arousing the envy of too many, they decided to join forces. Someone had accurately compared them to the union of trade cities in Medieval Germany,§! §OHansa,§! §RThe word was catchy, and it stuck.§!\n\nHanza is the largest and most economically powerful faction in the Metro. A Capitalist Alliance of independant stations, which has completely subjugated the Ring Line. Lording economic and political hegemony throughout the inner, and outer metro lines. Despite its peaceful nature, it much prefers to stay neutral if not ignorant of conflict. Chosing economic sanctions over direct military actions.\n\n However this almighty status would have not been without conflict; The bloody and ruthless Hanza-Redline War in the 2020s, paying the bloodprice personally for the war. While peace was achieved, it did little to quell the flames, with tensions slowly, but surely stirring all across the Metro. A major conflict will come. With Hanza being at its epicenter. Whether they like to or not."
 
 RCH_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "§R...and suddenly some time ago they appeared on Pushkinskaya.§! §OMetro is for Russians§! §RHave you heard that? Or this?§! §ODo good. clean the subway!§! §RThey threw out all the non-Russians from Pushkinskaya, then from Chekhovskaya, and they reached Tverskaya. Now they have the Reich there. Fourth or fifth...§!\n\nFormed from the collected mish-mash of Nationalist, Fascist and other Far-right groups, when the hermetic doors were sealed shut, it became evidently clear that the rear war had yet to begin. From the decrepit ruins of the old world a new one will ruise. A new order; one race, one people, one leader. Proclaiming themselves as the successors to Hitlers Nazi Germany, which once carved a bloody swathe across Europe leaving carnage in its wake.\n\nWithin Recent times they have managed to unify the neighbouring stations of Tverskaya and Chekhovskaya. The power of their current leader is now consoliated, his rule absolute. Dissenters have been purged and the loyalty of his supporters unquestioned. Now the real begins. A krieg of total annihilation of all lesser peoples and the triump of theirs. Taking it upon themselves to rid the Metro from all vile mutants and degenerate filth. The diseased, sick and ethnic scum will be wiped off the face of the earth. Reclusive, and repulsed from every and all corners of the Metro. They are willing to die to secure their Thousand Year Reich."

 PLS_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "§R... The last place on Earth where people live as people, where they still remember what the word human means, and how it should sound...§!\n\nPolis is a relatively young-state. Formed in the aftermath of the Hanza-Redline War. Most likely the last place on earth where people live like people. Where the spark of humanity has not yet snuffed out all together.\n\n Polis is a City State of 4 stations slap-bang in the epicentre of the Metro, consequently giving rise to its power. Not of war or industry, but as a sanctuary of scientific, artistic and musical knowledge. Those who are not able to fight, or the metro deems 'too inadequate' flock to Polis. Despite a being a 'life-boat' of knowledge in an otherwise ocean of ignorance, Polis keeps alive a perception of the world that many of its neighbours simply have forgotten. The world is ignorant of Polis, and so Polis is ignorant of the outside world. \n\n But as the gears of war slowly crank and turn, and beady eyes gaze upon its magnifience. The pen may be mightier than the sword, but it is no match for the barrel of a gun."

 SPT_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "§R...If not us then who?!...§!\n\n An elite force of battle-hardened warriors belonging to no ideology or nation and only serve the presevation of humanity. The Spartans, like those from ancient history are the most skilled and deadliest soldiers in the whole metro. The protection and preservation of humanity against whatever threats are their sole duty. Many of its former members serving in Russian Special Forces before the war. Or those who have served in other special, elite forces across the globe. They maintain a close relationship with Polis and its defense, and keep a neutral stance towards the bigger factions of the Metro. But with war on the distant horizon, and mutants scowl and embolden; for how long can they remain idle for?"

 ARB_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "§R...There was stencilling on the wall.§!\n§YThe Arbatskaya Confederation. Welcome!§!\n§RThe letters were half-erased, and it was immediately clear that it hadnt been repainted for a very long time. The guards conversed in a whisper and even hushed one. A dark, inexplicable fear crept out from the depths to greet him. It was quiet on the line. Some human voices were heard in the distance. mostly likely there was a patrol located there, too. It was one of the strangest posts that Artyom had seen...§!\n\nThe Arbat Confederation is a collection of stations composing of Kievskaya. A former member of the Anti-Communist Coalition which fought against Communists. Once having substantial power and a sizable population it is little more than an otherwise minor power within politiking of the metro. Severely weakened during the Hanza-Redline conflict, dependent on its emerging merchant class to keep the community from absolute destitution.\n\nPrimarily government by caucasian and non-russian inhabitants, the community attracts a rather large number of stalkers and diggers. Now with an unseen threat lingering within the shadows, its population stired up and anxious, reports from Park Pobedy tell grizzly acounts of more than mutants that stomp those abandoned halls. Neither man, nor mutant... But something else entirely."

 BAU_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "§R...For example, in Moscow we say there is such a real force - the Baumans. At the metro stations and in underground bunkers next to the Bauman School, which has long been a university, not scientists, but of engineers who gathered and formed their own commune. Unlike the 'clean' university, the Baumans were engaged in real engineering, and fought with the 'university' for power. However, these were only rumors. We've lived for ages in a world where everything was built on rumors, but for ages we've learned not to trust those rumors.\n\n§!One of the 'technical' powerhouses in the Metro, the Bauman Alliance is a technocratic commune of engineers and technicians housed on the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line. One of if not the first nation which sent expeditions to the irradiated surface shortly following the Nuclear Apocalypse, the Baumansky Alliance employs a large degree of stalkers. The Station makes its living selling, repairing and modifying pre-war equipment and technology.\n\nWhile chosing to remain 'neutral' during the Hanseatic-Redline War, the Bauman narrowly escaped the ruination which many of its participants endured. But as threats begin to stir, even more closer to home than the seemingly distant Sokol branch, not to mention the seemingly bizarre reports of encounters with hostile Stalker teams on the surface. How long can the Alliance sustain their neutrality?"

 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Almost two-decades have cultivated various communities. All with their own seperate identities. Engaging in trade, diplomacy and warring amongst one another. Many of whom by and large are ignored by the bigger political turmoil. Only sharing one thing in common; survival. Struggling to meet ends in this decaying world."

 GWC_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "§R.... There are rumors that people from the Park did not die. But they also ceased to be people...§!\n\nThe Metro clings onto semblance of order, but there are those who defy civilization entirely. Those who are no longer human, and neither mutant. Pale, gaunt and skeletal-like figures skulk in the dark recesses of the underground. Waiting, preying for their time to strike."

 TRT_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "§R... The subterranean Venice...An island on the dark waters of underground rivers...§!\n\nIntersecting where 3 tunnel lines meet is the Bandit Triangle. A location of wealth and power, being partially flooded giving it the name of 'Venice' based upon a great city of Ages Past. Its a hive of scum and other dregs that the Metro habours. A city of sin, and of opportunity run by thugs and gangs. Organized crime hustles and schemes out in the open.\n\n Whilst Venice is unlike any other place in the Metro, a place free from the shackles of ideology or prudence. If the Bandit Triangle were to organize and appear as not just mere bandits. They could become a major new power within the metro, if not one to be respected."

 ULI_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "§R... At first perhaps, they had a Confederacy, and then only the name remained...§!\n\nA left-leaning community occupying the northwestern section of the Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya line. It is becoming increasingly poor from economic decline, internal strife and mutant attacks. With Hanza closing in to swallow them hole, the confederation needs to stand firm strong one-by-one, or be blown away by the coming storm."

 SEV_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "A station of Engineers, but most predominantly soldiers. Every citizen trained to fight the mutants who skulk from the southern tunnels. It is an important station which provides power to most if not all of the Southern Metro."

 VDN_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "§R...Mark my words, they will create an alliance, and VDNKh will steer...§!\n\nThe VDNKh is a peaceful trading community reknowned for their mushroom tea. Able to live quite comfortably through trade with its neighbours and partners from afar. Hosuing its own public library and with high rates of literacy."

 SCA_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "§R...But if you think only about eating, sleeping and multiplying, then you really don't need any museums, schools, shakespeares and so on. What is easier is to bury yourself in the ground, like moles, lose your human appearance ... In every sense. I don't know how the residents of your part of the metro are doing, but we don't want to get stuck!...§!\n\nRatmen. Mutants. Scaven. Described as human-rat people who skulk the northern metro lines. Once fellow humans who became diseased-riddled and suffered horrible mutations. Those who survived the initial infection became whatever final forms they are now. Describing the human-rat people. Ridiculed they became reclusive from the rest of the Big Metro. Isolated away from the rest of the Metro, the Commonwealth of Scaven Stations seeks nothing more than peaceful seculusion. Considered nothing more than vile-mutants by other denizens of the Metro.\n\nThe Scaven despite what is often described as just mere mutants takes great strides within the preservation of humanity. Juxaposing their disposition with outsiders to their internal affairs. Whilst their human appearance has withered, their spirit and minds won't. As their former kinsmen rejected and shot them, and so the Scaven detested humans for it."

 ISL_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Inhabited by the Scaven. The Caliphate is inhabited by those of Caucasian lineages. The Caliphate is a slave-caste society based upon blood and purity. The lower castes of the Scaven are enslaved. Gridlocked in a constant conflict with the cackling 'kafir' of the south."

 SAT_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "As Heaven and Hell collided when nuclear armageddon struck the earth, it only made sense for those survivors to fall onto superstition. Some to God, and others to ancient deities long forgotten. But some called reverence upon the cruel and wicked.\n\n prowling and lurking within the once-abandoned station Timiryazevskaya. Believing that Hell has come to earth, and Moscow itself is a gate to the underworld. Its now alight with the cries of numerous captives, as the station is dotted with candles and marks of Satan himself."

 AVT_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "§R...Under the command of Commissar Rusakov, the Brigade rolls almost all over the subway, conducting subversive activities, and making short sabotage sorties at the station of the Fourth Reich§!...\n\nNot all communists flock to the Sokolnicheskaya. From the station of Avtozavodskaya comes the First Interstational Brigade of Che Guevara. To some they are freedom fighters who stand steadfast against tyranny and opression, to others they are no more than bandits with an ideological conscience. To most however, they are unheard, unseen. Fighting a guerilla war against the Redline and Reich. But to their followers they are the only true upholders of the Revolutionary Ideals of Karl Marx, and seek a glorious permanent revolution across the Metro.\n\nCondemned by the Politburo of the Redline, and outcast for their anti-stalinist and authoritarian stance. As the Redline condemns them, so likewise does the Interstational Brigade in return."

 EUR_BOOKMARK_DESC:0  "A strange sight to to the denizens of the Undermetro, the Europa Commonwealth resides upon the Filyovskay line. Housing presumably the only sizable amount European descendants - former businessman and employess who worked in the bsuiness district of Moscow City. Reclusive from the rest of the metro, the Europa Commonwealth sticks to their own. With the seclusion many smaller communities sprouted up inside the Europa Commonwealth itself, based upon ethnic and nationalistic grounds. Cultural clashes are frequent, with divisions cracking further daily.\n\nAnd yet as chittering whines and shifting shadows are heard deep within the tunnels leading to Park Pobedy, it appears their isolationist stance has done little to keep them away from peering eyes. Together we stand, divided we fall.
