With the winding back of our Militarist-style grain requisitioning, we can now focus on growing our economy."

 RED_assume_kulak_property: "De-Kulakization Campaigns"

With added independence however, it has been a growing concern that some of our farmers may indeed be too better for their own good. Farmers who have already begun selling 'too much' grain.

Not to mention those within our own party who have fled, with secretive documents which could damn the entire Red Line if they fell into wrong hands. Andrey's government is in peril.

Make it be clear; you are either marching beside the banner of the revolution; or against it. No more than the capitalist, fascist lazy infiltrators. Many still are loyal to Andrey's authority, and more faithful to the Red Line. Their support must be echoed and strengthened."

 RED_HNZ_enemy_desc: "While the Reich are our greatest enemies the bloated capitalist of Hanza are a not far behind. They have killed so many of our people, prevented a peaceful unification of metro and built prosperity out of their workers suffering, among so many other crimes they have committed. No longer will we tolerate it, it is time to crush the specter of capitalism once and for all. The time is now for the 2nd and final Hanza-Redline War."

 ######Friends######
 RED_breakaways: "Foreign Friends"
 RED_breakaways_desc: "Previously we avoided relationships with the various socialist factions that exist, due to them refusing to subscribe to our ideology. Now that we have many of the strongest factions in the metro arrayed against us, it is important to take what friendships we can get. After all a confused communist is better to deal with then a capitalist or a fascist."

 RED_1905: "[ULI.GetNameDef]"
 RED_1905_desc: "The 1905 Confederation is a coalition working toward peaceful Marxist collectivism. Unfortunately all that boils down too is a bunch of loosely organized peoples who cannot even agree on the same terminology for the ideas they use let alone work together for some broader goal. We once tried to show them the errors of their ways which they ungraciously refused and now they are stuck between the Fourth Reich and Hanza, an unenviable position. Despite our differences in the past they are trying to follow Marx's teachings and do not deserve to suffer at the hands of fascists. Let us reach out once more."

 RED_1905_civ_1: "Joint Tool-Trades"
 RED_1905_civ_1_desc: "While the 1905 lacks any real outstanding qualities of their own, they do have a notable amount of tool makers who provide them with a steady surplus. While they are too small a market to make a difference in the Red Line, trade would improve their economy and paint ourselves in a better light."

 RED_1905_civ_2: "Unify the Diggers"
 RED_1905_civ_2_desc: "The 1905 like many of the states in the metro have digging teams who's whole job is to excavate tunnels and shore them up. However unlike most theirs struggle to maintain let alone expand their tunnels. This seems in large part due to many of the teams being just as factionalized as their government. If we were to send a small (but large to them) work crew to repair parts of the 1905's stations it would not only show them how to work together for a common goal but further indent their government to us."

 RED_1905_flavor_1: "Preaching Socialist Unity"
 RED_1905_flavor_1_desc: "The 1905 has always retained to qualities, a core of socialist ideology and a discordant political system. By flexing what little influence we have in the government toward working together toward a common goal. We can ease the main governments headache and ingratiate ourselves to them."

 RED_1905_flavor_2: "In all but name"
 RED_1905_flavor_2_desc: "Our efforts have borne fruit and the various station reps are shouting at each other less, while they are not in a state conducive of being a state yet. A large push from our representatives should finally make them realize working together is in their best interests, Even if the work is not exactly what they want."

 RED_1905_2: "Friendship with the Confederation"
 RED_1905_2_desc: "After strengthening their economy, and uniting their government the 1905 is finally willing to work with us. Together we shall build a more socialist world today instead of arguing about semantics and differences till the 2nd end of the world."

 RED_trotskyists: "The International Brigade"
 RED_trotskyists_desc: "There exists a small but stubborn collection of communists outside our influence, The First International  Brigade of Che Guevara or Revolutionaries as they are commonly called have bought into Trotsky's lies about Stalin and consider us enemies of the revolution along with the capitalist and fascists. While we are loathe to work with them they have survived against all odds including the work of the NKVD, this makes them a valuable assets even if we don't see eye to eye."

 RED_trotskyists_civ_1: "Shipments of Supplies"
 RED_trotskyists_civ_1_desc: "Do they believe the false lies of a madmen?- §RYes§!./nHave they liberated their workers?- §RAlso Yes. If no nothing else we should provide them with the means of production as they are more worthy of it then every other state in the Metro.§!"

 RED_trotskyists_civ_2: "Funding the Fight"
 RED_trotskyists_civ_2_desc: "While the specifics of said revolution are subject to discussion they are correct that the revolution is not currently over. Many workers remain to be liberated from their shackles, and there are few outside the Revolutionaries more eager to set them free. Since this is the case we shall provide them the tools with which to break their chains."

 RED_guns_for_you_guns_for_me: "Guns for you... Guns for Me"
 RED_guns_for_you_guns_for_me_desc: "While giving guns to an unstable hostile state can be seen as self sabotaging. If you look at it from another perspective as long as they point them towards the real enemy we've effectively gained more soldiers. This is geopolitics, or metropolitics I suppose."
 
 RED_trotskyists_flavour_2: "Joint Production Collaborations"
 RED_trotskyists_flavour_2_desc: "Now that they have made it a habit of not shooting us with our own guns we can feel more comfortable with providing the Revolutionaries with weapons. While we need all the guns we can get we do have a great deal of spare parts and weapon grade materials. By sending these they should find it much easier to build their own guns."

 RED_trotskyists_2: "A Worthwhile Friendship"
 RED_trotskyists_2_desc: "While there are still some things they aren't quite right about the Revolutionaries are easily the most similar to us politically, and if we can look past these inaccuracies into correctness, we will find a suitable ally. Now come fellow Communists onward to the Revolution!"

 RED_anarchists: "Anarchists"
 RED_anarchists_desc: "There exists some foolish breakaway state far removed from the impotent happenings of the Metro that has decided to obsess over the childish idea of anarcho-communism. The only thing more infuriating then that is the fact we should probably try and bring them into the fold. They do stand for the liberation of workers and hate Hanza and the Reich just as much as we do. Plus if you squint at it, the word kind of looks like just communism."

 RED_anarchists_2: "Mutual Trade"
 RED_anarchists_2_desc: "Even though the anarchists are far away and trade with them is difficult due to competitors, we must be able to send regular military detachments to be able to at least inform about all threats and 'exchange' some knowledge."

 RED_anarchists_3: "Fight Against Fascism"
 RED_anarchists_3_desc: "It was actually surprisingly easy to get them on board with an alliance. While our efforts to get them to abandon their anarchistic ways proved to be unsuccessful as soon as we started talking about killing capitalist and fascists they were eager to join forces. And for now that is some excitement we can get behind."

 RED_technicians_factories: "Send Food Shipments"

 RED_technicians_supply_our_arms_desc: "While the Armory easily knows the most about weapons in the metro, we aren't lacking in knowledge ourselves. By combining what we both know together we are certain to result with more then the sum of our parts combined."

 RED_technicians_faction_member: "Fellow Member of the Union"
 RED_technicians_faction_member_desc: "While we may look down upon other states who lack our supreme heritage, the Armory is an exception. They could have easily monopolized their weapon production for their own personal gain. Instead they have shared their weapons with us only in exchange for what they need, it is time to formalize our ties in an alliance. With the Armory at our sides there is nothing we can't do!"

 RED_rail_vehicle_designs: "Rail Vehicle Schematics"
 RED_rail_vehicle_designs_desc: "Using their extensive connections throughout the entire Metro, our friends in the Armory have compiled an almost complete rail panzer schematics. If we study these schematics we can catapult our own project ahead by years of research."

 RED_joint_arms_deal: "Joint Arms Pact"
 RED_joint_arms_deal_desc: "To take advantage of our new puppets capabilities we will need to expand the resources available to them. We will begin collecting and shipping all of our old or defunct weapons to the Armory. Once there, the workers will begin combing through the mountains of guns for good parts which will then be used to make new guns."

 RED_SSK_1_desc: "The Sretenskiy Bul'var are a small unremarkable station on an unimportant line that we happen to share a border with. While it does not offer us any real benefit, its greatest incentive is its lack of incentive. There are no major powers courting them or even caring about them, meaning we can influence them and the Metro as a whole won't really care."

 RED_SSK_2: "Integrate [SSK.GetName] to our Sphere"
 RED_SSK_2_desc: "While the Bul'var have responded positively to our investment, as time goes on our foreign department finds themselves repeatedly asking themselves why are we even bothering?
