 nf_hanza_satellite_puppet.1.t: "Shadow over [ROOT.Capital.GetName]"
 nf_hanza_satellite_puppet.1.d: "Intelligence reports suggest that elements of organized crime have managed to expand their influence through the trade vendors entering our station. Smuggling contraband, expanding shady black market operations and racketeers of illicit goods have begun to become noticable by our administration. The fact that our local guards seemed suspiciously eager to cooperate and allow these networks to expand is something to keenly be worried about. The Hanzas official stance is all bandits should be terminated with prejudice.. Good thing we're technically not the Hanza. These bandits strike some convincing offers. Afterall; They don't have to know, do they?"

Allowing their trafficked goods to flow steadily through our station unmolested for a pinch of the pie, and keeping their tracks beneath the Hanzas radar. The fact our officials have been wooed this easily with the prospect of goods is wildly concerning.. However."

Officials taking bribes, diverting Hanza funding and cooperating with local tunnel gangs who profited from illicit trade routes passing straight through Hanza territory.\n\nOur Administration is outraged, station officials of the Commonwealth are demonstrating their frustration, demanding justice and accountability of moral decay. The time for any damage control has ceased, action has to be taken."
 nf_hanza_satellite_puppet.3.a: "Inquiries wont do anything. Actions shall speak."
 nf_hanza_satellite_puppet.3.b: "Supress condemnation, we cant afford to deal with this right now."
 nf_hanza_satellite_puppet.4.t: "Station Fit for a King"
 nf_hanza_satellite_puppet.4.d: "Recent reportings have come to our attention of a notorious bandit is currently taking residency at our station. The fact that our own security forces were aware of his notoriety, and let managed to slip his way past processing is deserving of scrutiny in of itself. What more is cause for concern is that a great deal of our residency know of him - for good reason. With many acquaintances and many more favours and debts owned it seems likely he'll bring nothing but trouble if he sticks around for long."
 nf_hanza_satellite_puppet.4.a: "He May stay, provided he keeps his bar tab in-check!"

 nf_hanza_satellite_puppet.5.a: "Sure."
 nf_hanza_satellite_puppet.5.b: "No. You're pushing your luck, sonny jim."
