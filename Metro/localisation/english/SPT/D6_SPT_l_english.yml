 nf_D6_advisor.1.t: "Unlikely Help"
 nf_D6_advisor.1.d: "It seems the occupation of D-6 has attracted a great deal of attention - wanted, unwanted or which may seem to be in our favour. This one such instance is undoubtedly the case. Recently our sorties had detained originally believed to be an enemy operative orbiting close to D6. However through interrorgation the solider claims to not be a spy of any sorts, but infact one such former remnant of the D6 committee itself. Hailing us for ridding the biomass which infested the bunker. Originally asisting with calculating the effectiveness of virtual reality combat simulations, the work was subsequently halted when D6 was evacuated. Rather than fleeing to Polis alongside the rest of the science team, the soldier vanished. Seemingly wishing to divulge little on where he had been in the elongated stretch of time, the soldier wishes a great deal to join our ranks now that D6 has been re-colonized and revivied into working order. Offering his sworn allegiance."

 nf_D6_advisor.2.d: "Whether killed in the ensuing battle for D6, slipping before the battle had even began, or enduring on to the bitter ends and ending up as another tally of casualties littering the Installation, the Captain has departed from service following D6 slipping from our hands. An unfitting end, to say the least."
