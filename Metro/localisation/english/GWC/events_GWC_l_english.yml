 nf_GWC.3.t:0 "Followers of the Worm"
 nf_GWC.3.d:0 "Park Pobedy remained intact following the war, More so than neighbouring stations making it a wealthy power. Being close-friends with the Arbat in the past. However when the Arbat Confederation decided to fight against the looming threat of Communism, Park Pobedy decided to backstab its former friend, drunk from grandiose delusions of power. What seemed to of been a dirty fight soon turned sour. The Arbat made a rash-decision to blow up the tunnel leading into Park Pobedy, thusly trapping the citizens and cutting them off from the rest of the Metro.\n\n The inhabitants were doomed. Incapable of becoming self-sufficient, or venturing onto the surface. All of those that tried to trek above ground never came back. Over time, Park Pobedy became disheveled; rioting, looting and acts of cannibalism of the deceased took place. Leaders came and went, incapable of quelling the de-grading horde of struggling survivors.\n\n Until one rose to heed the crowd, dubbed 'Priest' who managed to subvert and reign leader of the hopeless crowd of people. His belief that the metro was created by a giant worm, and that humanity was birthed from it. The nuclear apocalypse was the Great Worm punishing humanity for its ignorance and technology. Captiulating the population with his word, he sprouted a rebellion and a cult centered around the worship of the Worm. His first decree was to."
 nf_GWC.3.a:0 "Heathens to be boiled alive"
 nf_GWC.3.b:0 "Park Pobedy was to take a new, twisted macabre form."

 nf_GWC.4.t:0 "Leader of the Worm"
 nf_GWC.4.d:0 "Priest soothed and nutured the fears of his flock, over time they followed his every order and decree without question. Teaching his disciples from the word of the Worm Himself. Acting as a messenger to his will. The developement of technology always innevitably leads to the production of weapons of war. Humanity must heed to the teachings of the Worm, the grownups are unable to reason or question, and must be removed. Whilst Children are to be taken, and taught the true way of the Worm."
 nf_GWC.4.a:0 "Priest teaches us of the sins of technology"
 nf_GWC.4.b:0 "Priest teaches us the sanctity of the worm"

 nf_GWC.5.t:0 "Infidels of the Worm"
 nf_GWC.5.d:0 "Now, with the reports of heathens settling nearby to our domain in the nearby station of Molodezhnaya and Strogino. This has moved Priest to decree that our efforts must not falter but increase. More meat for our granaries. More bodies to purport the word of the Worm. The Great Worm himself desires his favoured sons and daughters expand the beating heart of his cult outwards from our territory. The subway will run red with the blood of those who dismiss the Worm for he is all. The great worm is all. The great worm is Life!"
 nf_GWC.5.a:0 "Our Cultists will dine on their flesh"
 nf_GWC.5.b:0 "Our warriors will feast on their marrow"

 nf_GWC.6.t:0 "Warrior"
 nf_GWC.6.d:0 "Whilst Priest himself resorts to pacifist means, he understands that humanities ignorance is too great. He wishes that the heathes would listen, but knows this can never be so. Technology leads to bloodshed, and fire must be fought with fire. One of his disciples knows this more than anyone. Dubbed 'Warrior' a towering figure above the rest. Heathens who step into the domain wishing to commit harm are slain single handedly in combat by him. A fitting figure to lead the Word of the Worm."
 nf_GWC.6.a:0 "Warriors knowledge of the tunnels is unmatched"
 nf_GWC.6.b:0 "Warriors knowledge of warfare is unmatched"

 nf_GWC.7.t:0 "Depot Cracking"
 nf_GWC.7.d:0 "We had managed to find a way through on the other side of the metal door. A small air vent up high upon the wall circumnavigated the perimeter of the site. The sounds which came from beyond the door turned out to be of human origins. The Depot had been used as a makeshift HQ for a band of stalkers, using the site as a launch pad to scavenge the surface. Stalkers would make their trips to and from, using the depot itself as a headquaters of sorts. Our scouts managing to open the door. Their kalashnikovs stood no chance against our grit."
 nf_GWC.7.a:0 "Meats back on the menu boys"

 nf_GWC.8.t:0 "To the Victors..."
 nf_GWC.8.d:0 "We have claimed many new stations under the name of the Great Worm, and whilst the people of these stations are under our subjugation they are ignorant to his name. Despite enslaved and shackled to do our bidding they persist to deny the truth. How should we proceed with them?"
 nf_GWC.8.a:0 "Take a more forceful approach"
 nf_GWC.8.b:0 "If our Hypnotists cant break them, the whip will"

 nf_GWC.9.t:0 "Who will become the Meat?"
 nf_GWC.9.d:0 "Meat is the one of the most precious resources we have at our disposal."
 nf_GWC.9.a:0 "Why let good meat go to waste?"
 nf_GWC.9.b:0 "Imprison them, so they can be eaten later"

 nf_GWC.30.t:0 "Bump in the Night"
 nf_GWC.30.d:0 "Over the past few days, citizens have been going missing from our station. It started subtle at first; missplaced items and movements in the shadows. Not before long did reports of missing people come to our attention. Men, women and even young children vacant from their tent-homes. With no reports of their whereabouts, and even more distressing gossip about the reasonings for their disappearances. Some reason that they simple got up and moved to another station, doubtful considering they left their belognings in the station. whilst others fear its the manifestation of ghosts and spirits of the deceased rising to reclaim the sin-riddled souls of humanity. Albeit with the recently arisen rumours abound of people from Park Pobedy who did not die, and managed to survive. Transforming into wicked and cruel monstrosities. No longer man nor beast.\n\nOur peoples fear that the worst has yet to arrive."
 nf_GWC.30.a:0 "Oh No"

 nf_GWC.31.t:0 "Stolen Resources"
 nf_GWC.31.d:0 "More resources have gone missing amongst our station. Entire stockrooms have become devoid of resources which were placed only only hours ago. This doesn't seem to be the work of bandits, since most thugs only care about scurrying off with the valuables. Rapid reports, and the general declining situation suggests something, or someone else is the culprit to be blamed. Something seldom sought to bring to light by our station governance as to not strike pandemonium amongst our community."
 nf_GWC.31.a:0 "Damn"

 nf_GWC.32.t:0 "Sabotage"
 nf_GWC.32.d:0 "Much of our core infrastructure and sites have been sabotaged by an unseen entity. It will take time for us to repair the damages."
 nf_GWC.32.a:0 "Damn"

 nf_GWC.33.t:0 "Frightened Traders"
 nf_GWC.33.d:0 "Ambushed in the darkest elapses of the tunnels, or intersections where the tracks are the most quiet. Tradesmen are reluctant to make entry into our station in fear of being attacked by these so called unseen men. Some even swear they would rather be making the haul between Sevastopol and Hanza through the Serpukhovsko-Timiryazevskaya than endure the extent of tracks between our territory."
 nf_GWC.33.a:0 "That is not good"

 nf_GWC.40.t:0 "Eyes in the Deep"
 nf_GWC.40.d:0 "Over the past few days, citizens have been going missing from our station. It started subtle at first; missplaced items and movements in the shadows. Not before long did reports of missing people come to our attention. Men, women and even young children vacant from their tent-homes. With no reports of their whereabouts, and even more distressing gossip about the reasonings for their disappearances. Some reason that they simple got up and moved to another station, doubtful considering they left their belognings in the station. whilst others fear its the manifestation of ghosts and spirits of the deceased rising to reclaim the sin-riddled souls of humanity. Albeit with the recently arisen rumours abound of people from Park Pobedy who did not die, and managed to survive. Transforming into wicked and cruel monstrosities. No longer man nor beast.\n\nOur peoples fear that the worst has yet to arrive."
  nf_GWC.40.a:0 "Oh no"

 nf_GWC.41.t:0 "Missing Children"
 nf_GWC.41.d:0 "The worst we believed was yet to arrive, and so has it arriven. Children, even some barely able to walk kidnapped into the dark! Their mothers are rightfully distressed. With this pandemonium breaking out, many more affluent citizens are seeking to move away in fear of their own children being kidnapped. We have ensured the mothers we will search and find their missing children, but without any tangible leads it seems it will be difficult."
 nf_GWC.41.a:0 "That is not good"

 nf_GWC.42.t:0 "Our Populace are Scared"
 nf_GWC.42.d:0 "More reports of activity has been reported by our populace, and this time we cannot just simply sweep it underneath the rug or conjure it to mass hysteria. Our populace swear they see shifting shapes in amongst the shadows, at the corner of their eyes and are scared to sleep at night in fear of being kidnapped. Extra sentries have been put on watch, but this will do little to reassure our people."
 nf_GWC.42.a:0 "Damn"

 nf_GWC.43.t:0 "Resources Stolen"
 nf_GWC.43.d:0 "Valuable resources have been stolen right from underneath our noses! With these resources gone, our technicians will have trouble producing equipment and meeting our quotas for the week."
 nf_GWC.43.a:0 "Damn"

 nf_GWC.50.t: "Cleansing Park Pobedy"
 nf_GWC.50.d: "The Vile cannibals of Park Pobedy are no more! Whilst some managed to slip deeper into the darkness, many lay slain before our feet. With their so-called leader dead, and many amongst his inner band also laid to waste it seems certain there is no chance that the Worm Cult may ever rebuild enough strength to strike fear again.\n\nMany captives have been freed from the shackles, and although seldom wish to share their horrifying experiences they endured, hailed our forces as heroes. Men, Women and Children praising the name of our station. Word will spread of this event undoubtedly which would be promising method of showcasing our strength and might."
