 revolutionaries_desc:0 "The Revolutionaries, or Trotskyists are a group of communists who believe in a permanent revolution, meaning that every station and group inside the Metro should revolt and support one another to create global Communism. Differing from The Red Lines' Stalinist view of one Communist nation. Little is known on the outside about their organisation, conveniently hiding themselves from public eye. While ideologically at odds with The Red Line, they are more determined to wage guerilla warfare against the Fascists of the Fourth Reich."
