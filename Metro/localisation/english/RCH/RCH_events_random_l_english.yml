 RCH_random_event.1.t: "Desertion Conspiracies"
 RCH_random_event.1.d: "Our intelligence has recently uncovered a desertion plot amongst a squad of our soldiers, and just in the nick of time too however. These soldiers were caught attempting to make a run across the border into the territory of the mutants. As to be expected, we have detained these would-be betrayers of the Reich. The question now is what should we do with them now that they are un custody. Guilty of conspiring to leave the Reich, or perhaps we may convince them to remain?"
 RCH_random_event.1.a: "Disloyalty against the Fuhrer is rewarded with death"
 RCH_random_event.1.b: "Hand them over to the execution squad, commence a public display"
 RCH_random_event.1.c: "Some.. persuasion could remind them where their loyalty lies"

 RCH_random_event.2.t: "Mutant amongst us?"
 RCH_random_event.2.d: "We have recently received reports that one of our commanding officers is in fact a mutant. The soldiers under him question his genetic purity, and firmly believe he is concealing the fact that he is indeed a mutant. They don't wish to under the command of a vile degenerate. They urge action from the higher ups. How should we proceed with these rumours?"
 RCH_random_event.2.a: "Execute him for being a mutant"
 RCH_random_event.2.b: "These rumours are unquestionably false."
 RCH_random_event.2.c: "Examine these rumours closely."

 RCH_random_event.3.t: "Exposed for being a Mutant"
 RCH_random_event.3.d: "As our soldiers predicted, the officer was in fact a mutant. Extensively searched by our gestapo, our officers found several marks of mutation across his body. Concluding that his deformerties were in fact birth-related our officers swiftly executed the officer without question. The soldiers underneath him sigh in relief, though the lingering thought of inspection for mutant-related defects still continues to linger amongst his ranks."
 RCH_random_event.3.a: "As suspected. Punishment. Death."

 RCH_random_event.4.t: "Accusations Unfounded"
 RCH_random_event.4.d: "Despite extensive searching by our gestapo officers and his initial refusals, his body appeared to indicate no signs of genetic deformities. Even further, his body proportions matched perfectly in-line with what is expected to be of the pure race. He is free to return to his active duties however the soldiers beneath him may be unlikely to accept him back, and may continue to grumble and decry he is in fact a mutant."
 RCH_random_event.4.a: "We need to dispel these rumours."
 RCH_random_event.4.b: "Whilst not a mutant, we can still save face."

 RCH_random_event.5.t: "Supposed Mutant Officer flees"
 RCH_random_event.5.d: "Detained for inspection, the officer accused of harboring deformities has slipped past our guards and escaped. Extensive searching for his whereabouts has drawn thin. Presumed to have fled the Reich. There is little evidence to suggest the mutants will take him in kind, and will undoubtedly devour him."

 RCH_random_event.6.t: "Formerly Accused Officer Slain"
 RCH_random_event.6.d: "Has believed, our worst reports have come into fruition. The officer was allowed to return back to his military duties, however the soldiers beneath him still unwilling to be lead by a supposed mutant. Culminating into the soldiers decided to slay the officer as he slept in his personal quarters. Once detained and questioned by our gestapo, the soldiers swear an oath of silence. There is very little point in pursuing punishment however, as the amount of soldiers which would be detained would be too great to lock up, or swiftly execute."
 RCH_random_event.6.a: "There was nothing we could do about it."

 RCH_random_event.7.t: "Accusations diminish"
 RCH_random_event.7.d: "Sent back to commandeer his military duties, the officer in question has seen no further issues from their soldiers. Despite the occasional whisper and slander aimed towards him. It seems that the accusations have completely diminished. Maybe the accusations were only in order to bunk the commanding officer off for his extensive drill routines and preference to use punishment to motivate his men?"
 RCH_random_event.7.a: "Thats good to hear."

 RCH_random_event.8.t: "Stranger at the Gates"
 RCH_random_event.8.d: "A cloaked figure stands in front of our entrance. Despite trespassing on your territory, and repeatedly coming out unscathed from volleys fired by our guards he remains insistent. Only seeking safe passage through our Domain. Despite his unshackled appearance he wishes no harm, and his destination he claims will only serve the wishes of the Reich in the long run."

 RCH_random_event.10.t: "Manpower Surplus"
