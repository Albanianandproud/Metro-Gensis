 AVT_army_without_a_state_desc:0 "Hopping from one station to the next, the brigade of Che Guevara is constantly on the march. Fighting a near constant guerilla war against the Fascists of the Fourth Reich, or the Stalinist menace of the Redline leaves very little time to hunker down and consolidate."

 AVT_ammo_reserves:0 "Siphoned Ammo Reserves"
 AVT_ammo_reserves_desc:0 "During the fallout with the Redline, the Revolutionists siphoned as much equipment as they could carry to aid them in their revolution. Secret supply caches dot the Metro in secluded spots and in far-hidden places. Only the comrades of the Revolution know of these places."

 revolutionaries:0 "Revolutionaries"
 revolutionaries_desc:0 "The Revolutionaries, or Trotskyists are a group of communists who believe in a permanent revolution, meaning that every station and group inside the Metro should revolt and support one another to create global Communism. Differing from The Red Lines' Stalinist view of one Communist nation. Little is known on the outside about their organisation, conveniently hiding themselves from public eye. While ideologically at odds with The Red Line, they are more determined to wage guerilla warfare against the Fascists of the Fourth Reich."
