 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Genesis"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "It has been 15 years since the day of Armageddon. On that fateful day humanity drew its last breath and casted itself into extinction. With the remnants taking refuge within the dark and dingy tunnels and systems which comprise the Moscow Metro. Cultivating its own law and governance within each station. While safe from the nuclear obliteration on the surface, the constant state of perpetual war, mutant infestations and now reports of an insidious menace stirring within the decrepit dakrness. Does Humanity have any hope of survival?"

 RCH_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Occupying the 3 stations of Tverskaya, Chekhovskaya, and Pushkinskaya exists the Fourth Reich. An all-slavic, neo-fascist organisation formed from the remnants of the Russian National Unity Party; Who Turnt to the grim history of the past as a means to endure the present. Proclaiming themselves as the successors to Hitlers 3rd Reich. Its their solemn duty to purge the Metro from all genetic inpurities and mutants. Finding themselves at odds, gridlocked in an eternal war with the rest of a metro. A struggle they are willing to pay to secure their Thousand Year Reich."
 
 MSU_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Nestled outside beyond the bounds of the Metro, is the Mythic Emerald City. Believed to be a cradle of old-world scientific knowledge and culture; far rivaling and exceeds anything of the likes from Polis. A bastion of peace and harmony in an otherwise ignorant and oblivious world. However what is truly known of their existance is little more than half-truths, incomplete rumours and tall tales from the bottom of a flask of liquor.\n\nBut just like the childrens book its name is derived from; its grandiose stature a mere fairy tale. A tenuous tale which is bound to crack."
 
 HNZ_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Hanza is a Capitalist Alliance of independant stations, which has completely subjugated the Ring Line, and boasts huge political and economic clout within the Metro. Peacefully trading with many neutral stations.\n However this almighty status would have not been without conflict; The bloody and ruthless Hanza-Redline War in the 2020s, paying the bloodprice personally for the war. While peace was achieved, it did little to quell the flames, with tensions slowly, but surely stirring all across the Metro. A major conflict will come. With Hanza being at its epicenter. Whether they like to or not."
 
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Almost two-decades have cultivated various communities. All with their own seperate identities. Engaging in trade, diplomacy and warring amongst one another. Many of whom by and large are ignored by the bigger political turmoil. Only sharing one thing in common; survival. Struggling to meet ends in this decaying world."
