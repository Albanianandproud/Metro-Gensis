 nf_PEC.4.d: "For what many had expected hesitantly, has finally arrived. Stepanov after years fighting against physical decline has finally found his end.

With his successor still up for question, Bormann's punks have slowly fanned their operations out from their turf of [409.GetName].

 nf_PEC.10.t: "Pechatniki Confederation"
 nf_PEC.10.d: "The Decentralized problem of the Confederation may largely only be a minor issue; compared to the Mutants from the south and Hanza encroachment to the North. However with Stepanov steering the Confederation hopefully these issues will be solved."

 nf_PEC.12.t: "Dealing with the Narco-Mafia"
 nf_PEC.12.d: "Settled upon Kozhukhovskaya, Bormann's gang are firmly entrenched at that station peddling dope and coercing passing traders to pay the hefty toll.

 nf_PEC.12.a: "They'll be a constant thorn, for sure."

 nf_PEC.13.t: "Brotherhood of the Yellow Sign"
 nf_PEC.13.d: "The Unfortunate rumours which plague Pechatniki station do indeed have some layer of truth. The majority of the population like most stations are good hardworking folk; but a few bad apples spoil the whole reputation of the bunch.\n\nSimply Referring to themselves the Brotherhood in Yellow, and draped in tattered rags - which give the impression of piss-stains rathen than yellow pigment; Golubev's rabble are no more keen on his maddened rambles as they are waiting to get their next warm meal. Believing that the apocalypse was the inaugural step into execution their plans to bring their supposed god into our realm of existence. Our security forces aren't quite sure when this Golubev individual turned up, or if he had always lived on Pechatniki station. Some believe he came wading straight from the southern tunnels themselves. Whatever the case may be, his followers have come to idolize him and much more his ideals.\n\nGolubev has accrued a rather sizable arsenal of weapons and firearms, our security forces a lead to believe. Hiding them in stashes out from prying eyes. Golubev swears certainty that their «God» will come in corporeal form in the south, once those stations have been dredged."

 nf_PEC.15.d: "Pechatniki administration have pressured us into yielding [416.GetName] and adjacent stations into their sphere of influence. They refuse the legitimacy of the current implemented administration, despite our mantle upon those stations being held for quite some time.
