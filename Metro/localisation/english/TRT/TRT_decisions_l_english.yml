 TRT_flooding_issue_desc:0 "Our §RBanditry§! problems are the least of our problems plaguing §Y[TRT.Capital.Getname]§!. §Y[ROOT.ADJ.Getname]§! didn't get its name magically out of thin air, but from the fact that our the streets are flooded. As snow and ice accumulates up top during the winter months, and thaws during early spring, the water naturally pours into the tunnels below. §YNo fucking shit..§! I hear you ask, but with runoff water having noplace to go, the subways tunnels below become even more full of water, risking flooding ever more with each passing season.\n\nWe may prepare §Yextensive measures§! and brace for further §OFlooding§!, but we will ultimately be at the mercy of the seasons until we can either navigate the bulk of water to someplace else. Or fix our tunnel §YInfrastructure§! all together.\n\n  Predicted Severity: [?Root.TRT_preparedness_requirement|H0]                                                           Current Preparedness:  [?TRT_preparedness|H0]\n\nIf that wasn't enough, we also have §Ymutant Shrimp§! to contend with. Swarming the underground river systems and bringing much strife to our trade networks. If their numbers swell, surely they'll seek to swarm §Y[311.GetName]§!\n\n   Shrimp Infestation: [?TRT_flooding_shrimp_problems|0R%%]\n"
