 nf_YAS.1.d:0 "Not much is known about life in the Yasenevskaya community. However, rumors say that its members are quite well off. Kaluzhskaya functions as a trading outpost, where caravans from other parts of the Metro buy and sell goods but are not allowed to go any further. The community is populated mainly by civilians. It's led by the former military official Pyotr Ivanovich Britvin, which is not surprising, because the Office of the Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation was not far from Yasenevo. The previous leader of this faction lost his life during an epidemic in 2020. Before the year 2020, Yasenevskaya Community used to control 7 stations - Kaluzhskaya, Belyayevo, Kon'kovo, Tepliy Stan, Yasenevo, Novoyasenevskaya, and Bittsevskiy Park, with Novoyasenevskaya being the capital of their community. However, the spread of an unknown infection brought by stalkers from the surface broke out at Novoyasenevskaya. This forced the inhabitants of Yasenevo and other stations to block the tunnel leading to Novoyasenevskaya, cutting it off, together with Bittsevskiy Park, where the infection also spread. This left the community with five stations, and Yasenevo becoming the new capital."
