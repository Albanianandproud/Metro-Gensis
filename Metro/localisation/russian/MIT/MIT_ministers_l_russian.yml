  politics_MIT_valentinovich_desc:0 "Head of Mitino Station, Semyon was born sometime in the 60s and was able to escape into the Subway. A strong-shouldered man at first glance, but deep within shattered and broken. Semyon lost much to the war, too much infact, and he fell into a deep depression. The bottle being his only acquaintance; and a belly full of liquor provides him of any respite from this decaying world.\n\nHowever, all that changed when he accompanied stalkers venturing forth onto the surface. With every expedition, came success, thanks inpart to Semyon sharp eyes and expertise in scouting and navigating the treacherous ruins of Moscow.\n\nValentinovich regained his composure and conscious; His vigour and life returned, dropping the bottle in exchange for overseeing the Commonwealth."
