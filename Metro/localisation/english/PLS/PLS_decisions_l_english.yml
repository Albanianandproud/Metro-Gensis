  PLS_mission_council_3_desc: "The Surface isn't supposed to be habitable til the dawn of the next century, but our Brahmins aren't content with sitting on their asses. A whole new goldmine of Scientific knowledge lays on the surface; ripe for our pickings. Just gotta send one, two or a dozen poor unfortunate saps up there."

  PLS_mission_council_4_desc: "The First round of experiments proved promising, but ultimately lacked the required expected yield in the eyes of our Scientists; their measure? More experiments must be concluded at this instant!"
