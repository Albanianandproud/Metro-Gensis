 nf_RED.1.t:0 "Revolution"
 nf_RED.1.d:0 "Its by no mere chance that the Red Line sprouted from the Sokolnicheskaya line. Every edifice and facade of the line is finely detailed with statues of Stalin, Lenin and other Socialist heroes. Monuments of once-revered saints lay as a surviving testament to the world before. Like Egyptian Tombs of yore, their ephemeral aura of power drew in those far and wide; pilgrims to witness what was and to pay their respect. Over a period of time that awe became reverence, and finally devotion. With the world as we knew gone, and only those faded memories of the past existed. It gave hope; an opportunity to build a new socialist bastion, unshackled from the burdens of the past.\n\nSurviving Komsomol figures and those who lived under the reign of socialism began to put in motion a socialist revival. Overthrowing local stations and installing revolutionary councils across the Sokolnicheskaya, declaring a first international; their goal, uniting the entire metro under Communism. Andrey Moskvin was one such revolutionary, his robustness and vigour personally spearheading the revolution and soon found himself overseeing the newly-established revolution."

 nf_RED.2.t:0 "Fallout"
 nf_RED.2.d:0 "However, what first began as social upheaval became a full-scale war with the rest of the metro. Many stations opposed the desires of the newly-established Red Line. Those on an ideological basis. Capitalist stations and others opposed to the workers revolution. The forming station-state of the Hanseatic League, diametrically opposed the Red Line, leading a coalition of stations to fight against the firebrand of the Revolution. Thusly started one of the bloodiest conflicts in the entire Metro. Bodies plunged into the meat grinder, and precious recourse churned for the war effort. The decrepit state of the Metro can be largely attributed to this war alone. A stalemate of attritional warfare, with neither side yielding, but giving it their all, and thus becoming weaker as the war elapsed. As the realization that the dream of a united Metro under socialism was fading, unrest and mutinies began to arise from within. Ideological differences spurred on full-scale insurrection, those leaving the fight and establishing their own stations, weakening the Red Lines support for the war in the process."
 nf_RED.2.a:0 "Their ideals grew too ambitious."
 nf_RED.2.b:0 "Our ideals shrank as the war waged on."

 nf_RED.3.t:0 "Peace"
 nf_RED.3.d:0 "As the war dragged on, neither the Red Line nor the Hanza saw any possibility of victory over each other. Pouring every resource they could scrap to kill, maim and destroy the other side with the end result being the inevitable decay of both parties. As both nations began to crumble and rot from the inside from exhaustion. citizens and soldiers alike protesting against the war. Too arrogant to kneel to the mob, either side were unyielding to submit to a peace agreement. If the deal was unfavorable to the ideologically-die hard amongst the ranks of each, it could lead to further disarmament and increased instability. Bot sides were too stubborn to come to peace, and only wished to proclaim a victory against the other.\n\nEventually however, peace was arranged in absolute secret. Eventually, Andrey came to realize the war could never be won against the Coalition. With every victory piled up bodies, more wasted resources. Was this really the price to pay for socialism? However peace was not his initial agreement. It was not even his dismay over the war, it was in fact his brothers own personal drive to declare peace.\n\nHis Younger brother, Maxim Moskvin, who oversaw the peace talks, at first without Andrey's knowledge. The deal commenced; Ploshchad Revolyutsii was to be given to the Red Line from Arbat. Arbat received the Biblioteka Imeni Lenina with eventually was handed over to Polis. A guarantee of free-access was agreed upon by all parties. The Red Line was cut in half. Andrey was championed by the people and the party alike for the peace. The inner circle of 'hard-blooded' socialists scorn at what they deemed a 'betrayal' of the revolution. Whilst all became unknowing that it was Andrey's own brother, Maxim being the true negotiator of peace. His feat hidden amongst the shadow. A starting point which planted his brothers growing resentment towards him."

 nf_RED.4.t:0 "State of the Line"
 nf_RED.4.d:0 "Andrey, a member of the revolutionary council, now saw himself as the General Secretary of the Red Line. Despite there being other competitors to that mantle, his will and tenacity saw him take to the mantle of leadership. His rule soon became unquestioned. However, now in 2028 as the ashes of the Hanseatic-Redline conflict begin to settle. The Red Line finds itself ever increasingly sliding into a more dire situation. The Sokolnicheskaya finds itself in a  precarious position which must be addressed with delicate hands. Many issues plague the nation, more within than without. The economy has grown stagnant; a policy of confiscation of resources levied to supply our military is still practiced, making our economy unable to grow and develop from a subsistence basis. Neglect over the governments willingness to handle this, spurred on by the military's bloated control over all facets of business and daily industry has spiraled into the commonfolk slowly detesting the local powers which be. Even with hushed whispers against the state itself. These issues have only grown and festered in recent months.\n\nThis is not the only problems to face us however. The Fascists pigs of Tverskaya have recently become invigorated thanks to their new Fuhrer. Scuffles on the tunnels between us has only increased from sporadic conflicts within recent weeks. Like the Great Patriotic War of old, we once fought and defeated them like. But it took a great deal of sacrifice. A monumental effort of blood and iron. Something way may not be able to afford right now.\n\nBut we must remind ourselves this General Secretary. We are the heirs of the Soviet Socialist Union. Lenin's will will not snuffed out!"

 nf_RED.5.t:0 "Question of Economy"
 nf_RED.5.d:0 "Our economy has quite simply, reached a slump. Despite our best efforts to reform and rehabilitate the economy which has proven to be inefficient. Most resources which haven't been allocated to the Military, or distributed to our R&D is used to resuscitate our stagnant economy. A more direct approach is needed; instead of resources being spent to just 'patch up' the bloating issue, a new method is needed.\n\n Two solutions have been proposed. Firstly is the implementation of grants and other schemes aimed towards improving our station administrations effectiveness at handling local issues. Secondly a more fundamental solution is prioritizing funds aimed at growing our primary industries such as construction and farming. Being able to be self sufficient and support itself and future growth."

 nf_RED.6.t:0 "Question of Military"
 nf_RED.6.d:0 "Our military. Once before the war the Soviet Union had one of the biggest and strongest armies in the entire world. Its armed forces were equipped with the latest and deadliest weapons of war, and drilled second to none. From the Taiga of Siberia to the Baltics Russia was supreme. The Army both protected, and preserved its workers and ideals. But now today it seems that is the other way around\n\n Through a long line of inner decay the military has slowly withered and fractured to bickering factions within the Military. Despite the sheer volume of manpower at its disposal the lack of proper training procedures, and even pressing disregard for any combined communication between commanders ensures the military remains isolated and bloated. Poor logistics and not to mention the severe corruption which is profoundly showcased with the high command. Outfitted in regalia and adorned with dozens of medals, most of which had not been awarded, but snatched from traders or scavenged. A military not of merit or skill but of arrogance, parading as generals."

 nf_RED.7.t:0 "Question of Grain Requisition"
 nf_RED.7.d:0 "Grain requisitioning is a double-edged sword. Providing our troops with the much needed supplies in times of strife such as the Hanza war. A war exclusively fought in little pockets and distraught all across the metro. Supplies being moved to and from, by an organized method was difficult given the linear nature of the war. So the Army resorted to confiscating grain and other resources to boost their stocks.\n\nWhilst this indeed proved successful, it did however be too efficient. A reliance upon this tried-and true method persisted. However despite the war becoming a distant memory the Military still practices it to this day. One contributing factor as to why our economy is in such a slump.\n\nIt'd be wise to demobilize our rate of confiscation, however its reliance upon times of War is not to be questioned, nor is it something to avoid when war does indeed becomes clear."
 nf_RED.7.a:0 "Decrease the intensity, but still maintain expected quotas."
 nf_RED.7.b:0 "We must limit all requisitioning now."

 nf_RED.8.t:0 "Question of Brotherhood"
 nf_RED.8.d:0 "Maxim Moskvin, Andrey's younger brother. Always in his shadow and always with a chip upon his shoulder. Maxim had always been jealous of his older brother. Andrey's charm, his success and power. A brotherly relationship rotted and no more than simple rivalry.\n\nWas there any respect Maxim held for his older brother? Hard to tell, but that love had been weathered and had withered away over the years to nothing. The only memories Maxim could give of their youth wasn't the bond they once shared, careless children but the bitter resentment he held.\n\nDespite this, Moskvin holds to him his own talents. He may never be anything like is more talented brother. But Maxim holds to him a resolve that few could attain. A strong brow, and an unquestioned authority few could dare to go against. Self confidence and true to ones self. Arrogance? possibly, but someone to lead, a figurehead."

Heralded by Kovshov who has assumed the mantle of leadership amongst the fractured ranks, his hears that inner reforms has made the Redline appear meek and fragile. Taking his most loyal soldiers into the deep recesses of the Metro to setup a base of operations to command and direct distraught cells of agitators.\n\nCaught between the crossfire, ordinary everyday soldiers and militias are stranded. As soldiers desert their posts, others take up arms and are cordoning entrances to and from stations. Blocking vital trade and access of people.

Many of its members former Russian State Security personnel, with even a handful being former KGB members during Russia's Communist days. Its main role then was to seek spies within the state and assist with squashing dissidents and anti-revolutionary figures. From then their power has maintained through its usefulness. Chekists guard many of the entrances to and from the Red Line, detecting would-be terrorists and spies.\n\nIts newly appointed leader, a man by the name of Korbut has risen through the ranks with incredible speed thanks in no part to his cunning and prudence abilities.

He has a built himself a ample reputation amongst the lower commanders. Idolized as a popular figurehead within the military. Viktor Kovshov was once a man who had nothing but respect for Andrey. It was him alone, with his reputation underneath his belt which ensured Andrey his current position of power. Kovshov is a die-hard communist much alike Moskvin, and the two ideals co-align. However Kovshov firmly believes in the power of the sword, whilst Andrey with recent years believing more so in the capabilities of the pen itself.\n\nKovshov staunchly believes that the Red Line at its current state is able to contest and fight against the Hanza. Hanza is weak, and inefficient at completely holding the ring line itself. Only through lightning action and conflict can the Red Line preserve its position. It is boxed in, corned by foes all around. Kovshov also insists upon removing, or limiting power the fickle politburo. With a personal grudge for pencil-pushers and other bureaucrats. His ire drawn towards the Central Metro Command in its early days, joining Andrey's revolt against the inefficient CMC.\n\nViktor is not too keen upon these recent changes, to say the least. Removing the influence of the military and replacing it with a centralized power structure which answers the general secretariat and his officials. No longer two entities but inseparable. Kovshov fears, like from history past. First, Perestroika, then Glasnot and finally the state crumbles under a tide of uncertainty. If... and when the government will stray away from its own ideals.

The accused found guilty. No hero funeral but to be executed at Lubyanka the following dawn. State security would handle their execution and subsequent purging. Any traces of their legacy ruthlessly quashed. Their bodies burned as not to inspire any acts of martyrdom.

 nf_RED.33.d:0 "It has become a topic of hot debate between Andrey's close committee. His brother on one hand, has grown with remarkable reputation amongst the lower military command. His recent handling of the Military has only proven this. New recruits idolizing him just as much as the commonfolk would with Andrey. Maxim is not a remarkable man in his own right, but is loyalty to the Red Line is one thing. With brotherly ties between Andrey and Maxim would ensure no treachery could take place. Maxim has often suggested and wished for a position of power and influence. To lead. Assigning him as the role of General of the Armed forces could give him just that. Its known that Maxim is disgruntled with petty jealousy over his older brother. Perhaps this new position would give him just what he wants?"

Some infested with mutants, bodies or other such horrible things. Whilst a fair few of them are being used as supply lines to fund the military mutineers. Its clear, that they're unable to fully produce and supply their own forces, furthermore accentuated by reports of their own forces being supplied by an external source who use secret tunnels to ferry weapons back and forth.

No more than thugs than a disciplined force, yet gouging themselves with armaments and weapons pinched from the Red Line as they turned their backs upon the Revolution for Personal profit.\n\nTheir Leader, dubbed simply as Master was once a low-ranking Officer, although recollection is still hazy and muddled. Having more of an ideological backbone - or just a fascination compared to the rest of his peers. Running his own station more like a boot-camp than a band of brigadiers. Although its clearly yet to be shown upon the tenacity of the troops. Being caught off guard by our forces. They shouldn't pose much of a threat. However their explosive equipment is a force to be reckoned with."

A bullet must have bounced off from a nearby wall which had hit him directly in the chest. Bleeding out and succumbing to his wounds as the firefight continued to rain hell in the station. Amusingly dying as he lived; cowardly and craven.\n\nDespite their leaders passing, the bandits still continued to put up much resistance. Cordoning much of the Station and retreating to each subsequent level as Red Line forces advanced. Fears that as a last resort the bandits would collapse the whole station were put at ease, as the bandits made headway to their last redoubt. One-by-one picked off and as the last remained, only a few escapees could flee into the deep darkness of the tunnels to be never seen again."

His own son disgusted by his father, resenting him. The corrupt and laughing-stock of a Socialist State is still corrupt just as the day he became General Secretary. Enemies lay all around, within and without which will snuff out the Revolution for good.\n\nMaxim's whole life was swallowed by grief and bitterness towards his brother. Always wanting something more from life, no amount of power or vanity could fill that void. He has no glory day to reminisce about, because he never found any fulfillment from life. Not with his brother, not before the war. A pitiful loser. Who will eventually find himself behind the barrel of an up and coming rival."
