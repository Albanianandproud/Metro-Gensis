 GWC_worm_military_1: "Warriors Call"
 GWC_worm_military_1_desc: "There are few amongst our flock who could best the Warrior in combat. Its unknown where about he came from, with some believing he was brought to us by the Great Worm himself. Only Priest, and Warrior himself know and they seldom seek to tell. Neither man, wicked or sacred has ever found themselves crossed in his maddening ire, and lived to tell the tale."

 GWC_worm_military_2: "Doped Shrooms"
 GWC_worm_military_2_desc: "The mushrooms which grow within our tunnel networks retain peculiar properties. Whilst looking withered and decaying, they possess hypnotic, almost magical properties. People who have eaten them describe seeing vivid images and hearing loud, almost deafening voices. May it be a direct communication link to the Worm himself? Priest believes not, however our warriors are adamant upon ingesting these mushrooms before going into battle. As they believe the imagery may predict future outcomes of battles to be, and to come."

 GWC_worm_military_3: "Preparing For Conflict"
 GWC_worm_military_3_desc: "Tucked behind the heathens and safe from view, we have had time to recuperate our losses and begin rebuilding in the Image that The Great Worm wishes. However as much as it is told that War is meaningless, we must defend everything we hold sacred by those who wish nothing more than to strike us down as simple tribals. They kill one another in the name of long forgotten figures and for material wealth, and yet we are nothing more than bloodthirsty savages."

 GWC_worm_military_7: "A Culture of Conflict"
 GWC_worm_military_7_desc: "Humanity has, and always will be a society built solely upon the bones and carcass of itself. No other being is able to wage war as complete and as effective as man.
