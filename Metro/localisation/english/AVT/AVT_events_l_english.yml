 nf_AVT.1.d: "Following the revolutionary fire which broke out on the Sokolnicheskaya line, but instead of simply just Russians, this revolution was fought by different peoples from all across the Metro. Under agreement, the two firebrands work in tandern to seek the entire Metro rise from the ashes of the old world and fly the revolutionary star across all corners of what remained of Humanity. Under an agreement with the recently established General Secretary of the Red Line, the Brigade did-"

 nf_AVT.2.t: "Independence"
 nf_AVT.2.d: "However, this alliance of interests would be short lived. Due to Ideological differences on how exactly the tennants of Marxism should be carried out between the Interstational Brigade, and the Red Line which by this point was increasingly falling under the iron fist of Stalinist sympathisers. The alliance was dissolved, and the Central Committee sentenced the brigade to be fugitives. Abandoning their post as their original base upon Partizanskaya was destroyed. And so the Trotskyists moved to Avtozavodskaya. A station untouched and ungraced by the revolution. When the Brigade arrived they.. "

 nf_AVT.3.t: "Fallout"
 nf_AVT.3.d: "Despite the differing of interests between the Brigade, and the Red Line, the Red Line continues to brandish us as traitors and dissidents to their cause within the higher ranks of the Red Line.

 nf_AVT.11.t: "Cracking the Computer"
 nf_AVT.11.d: "Fuck. You'd think we had been blasted back to the Paleolithic with all the knuckle-heads within our collective. A simple password, and yet we've been unable to crack it for the past solid while"

 nf_AVT.12.t: "Revolution, Revolution Revolution"
 nf_AVT.12.d: "Privet Tovarisch! We've found a pretty nice station to setup shop, don't you think? The local populace are amicable to our plight of interstational revolution, and other than the leaking radiation coming from the south and the occasional throng of mutants lingering up the northern tracks we're safe from any fascist or authoritarian scum.\n\nThough i've heard passing gossip between our revolutionaries; some amongst our squads are eager on us moving elsewhere. Perhaps it is in our best interest to move our base of operations closer to the other polities of the Metro? Or perhaps it is in our best interest to recover and regain our strength at [320.GetName] until it is an ideal time to strike forth?"
 nf_AVT.12.a: "[320.GetName] Suits finely as our Base of Operations"
 nf_AVT.12.b: "Perhaps we should move to [291.GetName]?"
 nf_AVT.12.c: "The Revolution has not yet concluded on the Sokolnicheskaya"

 nf_AVT.13.t: "Surface"
 nf_AVT.13.d: "There are plenty of priceless supplies in the wrecks of our expedition. Searching among the ruins and wreckages scattered in the snow and inside the buildings, we found numerous bodies. They're tangled together in a single frozen mass, as if these people were trying to find at least a bit of warmth just before they died. We can do nothing for them, not even bury them. However tattered amongst them various research documents lay dormant. Almost waiting for our sorties to discover them and the grizzly fate of those which perished surrounding them."
 nf_AVT.13.a: "Oh"
 nf_AVT.14.t: "[SSK.GetName] Integration?"
 nf_AVT.14.d: "[SSK.GetName] Has intergrated well into our sphere of influence. Already their populace are steeply coming to our side and way of viewing the world, perhaps too well as a matter of fact. Many amongst them are willing and eager to support our cause. Despite the station administration being on board with our goals they, and the wider metro may look strongly down on the population who are willing to join our faction."
 nf_AVT.14.a: "Yes, the proletariat must unite as one!"
 nf_AVT.14.b: "It would be wise for us to stay as two entities"
 nf_AVT.15.t: "[TRB.GetName] Integration?"
 nf_AVT.15.d: "[TRB.GetName] Has intergrated well into our sphere of influence.

 nf_AVT.16.t: "Attempts to slander the Fuhrer"
 nf_AVT.16.d: "Reports from The Gestapo has claimed that the neighboring mutant scum from Mayakovskaya have attempted to infiltrate our stations and are now poisoning the minds of our populace with their loathsome rhetoric. Calling our government and the Fuhrer himself incapable. How preposterous! What is worse is apparently these words have spread widely amongst our volk, and unless we clamp down will prove harmful."
 nf_AVT.16.a: "Clam down on the rumours this instance!"
 nf_AVT.16.b: "I sense another purge on the horizon"
 nf_AVT.17.t: "Sabogate in the Reich"
 nf_AVT.17.d: "In a daring act of defiance, spies have infiltrated Tverskaya. Portraits of our beloved Fuhrer have been vandalized, with crude drawings too crass to describe splattered across his visage. Station walls are coated in graffiti, scrawled in bold letters mocking the Fuhrer and his inner circle\n\nHowever they managed to slip through undetected by station guard or our citizens of the Reich remains unknown. This brazen act has sent shockwaves through the upper echelons of the Reichs leadership. Security is in turmoil; someone will take the blame and be ousted, as the Gestapo scramble to find a culprit, or a victim. Morale among the Reich's officials is shaken, and whispers of dissent grow louder."
 nf_AVT.17.a: "Cover this up as much as we possibly can."
 nf_AVT.17.b: "The Stationswache and his family, I want them gone!"
