 ### KRY ###
 politics_KRY_vishin_desc:0 "Before the bombs dropped Vishin found himself meandering from one occupation to the next. Being the son of a former Colonel in the Soviet Army he always felt he had something to live up to. Feeling dejected from not being able to follow in his fathers footsteps.\n\nNow? He lives life with a clear purpose; to defend §Yhis§! station. §YHis§! family. §YHis§! home. He will personally see to it that §YKrylatskoe§! station remains safe and secured from outside threats. And with reports of §RMutants§! in the tunnels to the south, he will do whatever it takes to live up to his fathers legacy."
 ### MDR ###
 politics_MDR_seredin_desc:0 "Born sometime in the late 70s, Nikolay Seredin joined §YOMON§!; a Special Police branch of the Russian National Guard. Narrowly escaping nuclear armageddon by taking refuge at §YPervomayskaya§! Station alongside close friend §YSergei Balagurov§! , usurped power from its former leader, and became president of the Republic.\n\nEver since then, the Pervomaisky Republic has seen relative peace and stability under his watchful, and aloof reign. Deciding the keep the community isolated away from the rest of the Big Metro."
 ### MIT ###
 politics_MIT_valentinovich_desc:0 "Head of Mitino Station, Semyon was born sometime in the 60s and was able to escape into the Subway. A strong-shouldered man at first glance, but deep within shattered and broken. Semyon lost much to the war, too much infact, and he fell into a deep depression. The bottle being his only acquaintance; and a belly full of liquor provides him of any respite from this decaying world.\n\nHowever, all that changed when he accompanied stalkers venturing forth onto the surface. With every expedition, came success, thanks inpart to Semyon sharp eyes and expertise in scouting and navigating the treacherous ruins of Moscow.\n\nValentinovich regained his composure and conscious; His vigour and life returned, dropping the bottle in exchange for overseeing the Commonwealth."

Andrey took charge of Council of Metro Workers, and began a full scale reunification of the Sokolnicheskaya Line under the banner of Communism. Under his leadership the spirit, and burning flame of Communism reignited. Personally seeing to the rebuilding and revival of Socialist traditions in the Red Line. Championed by the denizens of the Red Line; whether out of love for his gentle and caring rule, or politely obligated to by the barrel end of a rifle."
 ## DRY ##
 politics_DRY_godfather_desc: "Calling himself the 'Master' thanks in no part to steering the Dry Station bandits to where they are now. Formerly serving as a distinguished military general to the Red Line. Its not unclear whether he mutinied out of losing faith towards the Red Lines leadership or the ideals of Socialism itself. Craven, Manipulative and Cruel, the perfect talents for a leader of a band of blood-wretched misfits."

 ## PEC ##
 PEC_stepanov: "Stepanov Metchnikoff"
 PEC_STEPANOV_DESC: "With age comes wisdom. But no amount of it could forsee the collapse and regression of society. Stepanov, believing he was dawning on his sunset years immediately found himself knee-deep in the proverbial shit. Reluctant at first, he found within he had a strong, natural aplitude for leadership. His peaceful, amiable governance of the republic quickly spurred on a resounding age of peace his little slice of the Metro. Although within recent years his mental state has weigned slightly; no longer as sharp as he once was. The Republic is sliding ever so slowly into the dark. But Stepanov still permeates a bold aura even his few critics cannot tilt their nose towards."

 ## TRB ##
 TRB_zolotukhin: "Kamil Zolotukhin"
 TRB_ZOLOTUKHIN_DESC: "Adding the role of Station Chief to his repertoire came easy, though the position was thrusted upon him by the collective will of the station rather than his own desire. Being the oldest, and therefor most logical and wisest to lead. Undistinguished from the other inhabitants, he'd much prefer to get his hands dirty and work amongst his peers, rather than sitting in a cramped maintenance room all day listing station supplies."
