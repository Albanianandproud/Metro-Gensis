  doctrine_A_1: "Tier I"
  doctrine_A_1_desc: "Humans have always been better at killing than any other living thing. From when we first left our caves at the dawn of Humankind, to when we returned to those depths with weapon in hand. For what we may lack in skill or technology of our forefathers extensive preparation, emulating the tactics and technology of the old world shall our existence be claimed."
  doctrine_A_2: "Improvised Combat"
  doctrine_A_2_desc: "Up close and personal with the enemy all notions of reason must be ignored. Smash, rip, yank and bludgeon the enemy until a bloody pulp. Its kill or be killed."  
  doctrine_A_3: "Suppressive Fire"
  doctrine_A_3_desc: "The aim is to not hit the enemy, while that would indeed be an added benefit. The goal is to degrade the enemies ability to hurl back fire. Allowing our squads to complete their objectives."
  doctrine_A_4: "Obstacle Maneuvering"

  doctrine_A_5_desc: "Our armed forces cannot work in isolation. Each squad must rely on each other for tactical efficiency."
  doctrine_A_6: "Entrenched Positions"
  doctrine_A_6_desc: "Often times the best offense is a solid defence. Allowing enemies to come crashing into our defensible positions is often at times the best choice of action, and will wilt the enemy resolve just as much as it will their numbers."  
  doctrine_A_7: "Field Foraging"
  doctrine_A_7_desc: "Basic training in how to ration supplies, make best of bad or broken pieces of kit and hasty repairs out in the field must be conducted if our forces have a chance to hold fast beyond the hermetic gates of our settlements."
  doctrine_A_8: "Improvised Munitions"
  doctrine_A_8_desc: "When the situation demands it, improvised munitions can be used in a pinch. These dirty rounds will deteriorate firearms at a faster rate but keep the battle going. Beggars can't be choosers can they?"

  doctrine_A_10: "Human Zeal"
  doctrine_A_10_desc: "If Humanity wishes to live to see until the morning sun it must rage against the dying light. No loss can be too great if Humanity endures for another day."  
  doctrine_A_11: "Citizenry Obligations"
  doctrine_A_11_desc: "We cannot solely rely upon volunteers to fill out the ranks of our armed forces. It must be instilled to every one of our citizens that servitude is non-negotiable and everyone is liable to be called to duty."
  doctrine_A_12: "Nationalist Sentiments"
  doctrine_A_12_desc: "The time of petty regimes and struggles of the old world have faded. Now new politics and ideologies rise from their grave. We must make sure our worldview does not falter."  
  doctrine_A_13: "Force Multiplication"
  doctrine_A_13_desc: "We do not have the bodies, or morale to compose great feats. Equipment, training and tactics will give our forces greater effectiveness. Specialized detachments composed in order to complete specific tasks."
  doctrine_A_14: "Furor Muscovite"
  doctrine_A_14_desc: "Aggression cannot be met with reason. Reason cannot be met with aggression. We must combat fire with fire, and our forces fearless."

  doctrine_B_6: "Entrenched Recon"
  doctrine_B_6_desc: "Despite the static nature of the Metro, much in the way of reconnaissance may be deployed. Infrared, night vision and other equipment may be used to scout incoming enemies. Or more practical; floodlights."  
  doctrine_B_7: "Basic Field Kits"
  doctrine_B_7_desc: "We do not expect our soldiers to perform medical miracles out on the battlefield. However with the required equipment they may be able to stabilize major injuries, buying enough time to be treated behind the frontline."
  doctrine_B_8: "Blood Type"
  doctrine_B_8_desc: "Writing the blood types of soldiers on their arms or tattooed will allow for immediate blood transfusions in a pinch. Remember to wish them luck in battle."

  squadron_1: "Coordinated Instructors"
  squadron_1_desc: "Anyone can hold and gun and be told to shoot. Our Armed forces vary wildly in tactics and in skills. From those with extensive pre-war knowledge to those who have lived their entire lives beneath peeling white-washed ceilings. Collectivizing the best of this knowledge so that it can put to good usage should be our first fundamental step into reforming our armed forces."
  squadron_2: "Force Rotation"
  squadron_2_desc: "We must remember as much as we hate the ravaging, feral mutant beast in front of us we hold our families and loved ones behind us with love. Our soldiers are not infallible machines. Fixed rotation times between the front, reserves and off-duty will undoubtedly rejuvenate our armed soldiers."  
  squadron_3: "Conscription Standards"
  squadron_3_desc: "We must pluck the most competent and able from our civilian population. While in times of need, everyone must heed the call. Crippled and the sick are exempt from the draft."
  squadron_4: "MYOG"
  squadron_4_desc: "MYOG - Simply known as 'Make Your Own Gear' is a specialized form of improvisation and repairing bits of kit and modifying existing equipment whilst out in the field. Guns jam, webbing fractures and helmets crack, our forces are as only as effective as the equipment they fiercely keep in good shape."  
  squadron_5: "Basic Survival Training"
  squadron_5_desc: "Whether deep within the intestinal bowels of the Metro, or upon the bitter frozen surface survival of our troops is the upmost priority."
  squadron_6: "Compulsory Drills"
  squadron_6_desc: "The individual skills and weaknesses of our army will be tested in the field. strength, stamina and endurance must be at its maximum potential in every one of our soldiers."  
  squadron_7: "Macro-operations"

  squadron_9: "Blowtorch and Corkscrew"
  squadron_9_desc: "Americans once used a system to flush out the entrenched japanese forces all across the pacific. defences were obliterated by concentrated fire, whilst the defenders were routed out by lethal weaponry."
  squadron_10: "Maneuver warfare"
  squadron_10_desc: "Emphasizing movement, and quick thorough thinking and initiative to achieve a position of advantage will reduce the likelihood of incurring casualty losses. Engaging in disrupting enemy forces through maneuvers, rather than engagements"  
  squadron_11: "Case-Method Training"
  squadron_11_desc: "Everyone knows of the great patriotic war, the trenches of verdun to the Napoleonic campaign into Russia. But what of recent engagements? Written, documented or even retold events of modern, underground engagements will give the ability for new recruits make sense of the ever changing landscape of Warfare."
  squadron_12: "War Has Changed"
  squadron_12_desc: "In the darkness and uncertainty of the future, war has become the routine. No longer about nations, religion or ethnicity. War, and its consumption of life has become a well-oiled machine."  
  squadron_13: "War Never Changes"
  squadron_13_desc: "From when humans carved the first rock and used it to bludgeon the head of his brother, to the forging of the first iron point.

  commander_3: "Military Jargon Training"
  commander_3_desc: "Training new prominent commanders on key command terminology seems evidently a no-brainer. Hand gestures, etiquette or simply how to salute the rank is the first step."
  commander_4: "Command standardization"
  commander_4_desc: "Selecting the best candidate to lead the soldiers below him cannot be overstated. Drawing the short straw and letting any Pavel or Igor hurl his men straight into the fray is recipe for disaster."
