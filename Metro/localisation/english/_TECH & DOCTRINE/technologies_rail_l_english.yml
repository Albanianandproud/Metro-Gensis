   ### Rail Technologies ###
  rail_folder: "Rail Draisines"
  rail_folder_desc: "The Research & Production of Rail vehicles used wage war."
  rail_panzer_explosive_shell: "Explosive Shells"
  rail_panzer_explosive_shell_desc: "As opposed to purely kinetic ammunition, explosive shells use a chemical payload to create an explosion on or around the target, this is especially useful for coming up against armored targets."

 rail_cart_mounted_emplacement_tech: "Mounted Emplacement"
 rail_cart_mounted_emplacement_tech_desc: "Adding machine guns, or even small cannons to swivel mounts on railcarts will make it much easier to fire at targets while on the move."

 rail_panzer_sloped_armor_tech: "Sloped Armor"
 rail_panzer_sloped_armor_tech_desc: "Steeply angled armor on railcarts and Panzers can effectively deflect stronger munitions than armor mounted at flat angle."
 
 rail_reinforced_chassis: "Reinforced Chassis"
 rail_reinforced_chassis_desc: "Further reinforcement of the chassis the railcarts use will allow for more weight in either cargo, armor, or armament."

 rail_panzer_periscope: "Periscope"
 rail_panzer_periscope_desc: "Giving the commander of a Panzer a periscope allows him to have a 360 degree view around the tank, without having to open the hatch."

 rail_military_vehicle_salvaging: "Military Vehicle Salvaging"
  rail_military_vehicle_salvaging_desc: "Pre-War Military vehicles (Well maintained ones, anyway) were made out of highly durable parts, some of which can be re-purposed on railcarts."

 rail_industrial_vehicle_salvaging: "Industrial Vehicle Salvaging"
  rail_industrial_vehicle_salvaging_desc: "Industrial Trains and other mobile construction equipment was built to do work under load, meaning the components involved are perfect for the stresses of the Metro."

 rail_improved_fuel_storage: "Improved Fuel Storage"
  rail_improved_fuel_storage_desc: "Storing cans of fuel in easily opened compartments shielded from gunfire means that fuel is always on hand, and never lost to combat before the cart itself."
 
 rail_fuel_storage: "Fuel Storage"
  rail_fuel_storage_desc: "Storing racks of fuel in jerry cans and other containers on the cart will extend their range and reduce their burden on the supply chain."

 rail_cart_storage_compartment: "Storage Compartment"
  rail_cart_storage_compartment_desc: "It is necessary for rail mounted troops to have ample storage on carts for their belongings and any equipment not in use."

 rail_cart_jurry_rigged_handcrank: "Hand-Crank Mechanism"
  rail_cart_jurry_rigged_handcrank_desc: "While labor intensive, and not very fast, two person hand cranks can move carts faster than earlier designs."

 rail_cart_durable_chassis: "Durable Chassis"
 rail_cart_durable_chassis_desc: "Rail Chassis made of durable material can absorb more punishment, and carry more weight."

 rail_car_reinforced_rollers: "Reinforced Rollers"
  rail_car_reinforced_rollers_desc: "Reinforcing the rolling wheels under rail vehicles reduces the chance of derailment and allows us to put more pressure on them."

 rail_car_mounted_ammo_box: "Mounted Ammo Box"
  rail_car_mounted_ammo_box_desc: "Safely stored, easily accessible ammo increases both the longevity and combat effectiveness of rail vehicles."

 rail_automobile_salvaging: "Automobile Salvaging"
 rail_automobile_salvaging_desc: "Pre-War cars can be salvaged for useful components like engines, fuel tanks, and even bodywork when better armor isn't available."
 
 rail_armor_plating: "Armor Plating"
  rail_armor_plating_desc: "Armor plated in overlapping layers instead of one large piece of metal increases the protection of the cart across the board."

 rail_car_turret: "Rotating Turret"
 rail_car_turret_desc: "Having a turret that can fire in any direction is necessary for the development of rail tanks and turret cars."

 rail_cart_mounted_emplacement_tech_2: "Improved Emplacement"
  rail_cart_mounted_emplacement_tech_2_desc: "Adding gun shields and cover to weapon emplacements will make them safer to use, and thusly deadlier on the battlefield.

 rail_plough: "Mounted Plough"
 rail_plough_desc: "Cart mounted ploughs will make clearing light debris off the railroad both easier, and quicker, allowing carts to break through tougher terrain."

 rail_car_wiremesh_front: "Wiremesh Windows"
  rail_car_wiremesh_front_desc: "Wiremesh Windows are more resistant to attacks from mutants and ambushes than either glass or open air."

 rail_improved_fuel_storage_2: "Large Fuel Storage Containers"
 rail_improved_fuel_storage_2_desc: "Increasing the volume of fuel stored means even less need for constant deliveries from the logistical corps."

 rail_reinforced_hull: "Reinforced Hull"
 rail_reinforced_hull_desc: "Using stronger materials on the hulls of rail vehicles will increase their general durability."
