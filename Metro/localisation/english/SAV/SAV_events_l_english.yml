 nf_SAV.2.t: "Satanist Raids"
 nf_SAV.2.d: "The Satanist forces of Timiryazevskaya have launched a covert attack on our station. Slipping through the darkness, their forces managed to slip through our defences only to wreck havoc across our station. Despite being able to drive the thugs back, they managed to slither back largely unharmed, with captured cultists choosing to shoot or self inflict wounds upon themselves rather than to become prisoner.\nDespite being a victory against the forces of Darkness, the fact they managed to go by undetected has distraught our populace, and many feel unsafe."
 nf_SAV.2.a: "They will pay in time."

 nf_SAV.3.t: "The Alliance Crumbles"
 nf_SAV.3.d: "Marred by squabbles and controversies, the alliance has reached beyond its breaking point. The station of Tsvetnoy Bulvar realizing the futility of the Savyolovskaya Alliance experiment, has today decided to break free from the alliance."
 nf_SAV.3.a: "Some cried, but most simply watched."

 nf_SAV.5.t: "Back in the Saddle"
 nf_SAV.5.d: "With some convincing, and monetary compensation for his efforts, one of the original inventors of the first flamethrower has been convinced to pick back where he had left off and continue designing. As long as we procure the necessary tools and equipment to fund his efforts, he'll be able to work."
 nf_SAV.5.b: "Hopefully this effort will bore fruit."
 nf_SAV.5.b.tt: "Time will be spent working on a new iterative design of Flamethrower."

 nf_SAV.6.t: "The First Benchmark"
 nf_SAV.6.d: "Though 20 years can change a man, our technician soon found himself back at work setting about improving the design of the first makeshift flamethrowers used all those years ago. Obviously a much longer process, considering only a single smith is working on its design rather than almost half a dozen. Some prototype redesigns have been conceptualized, further improving upon its design and efficiency, but testing still needs to be made."
 nf_SAV.6.a: "This design will do for now."
 nf_SAV.6.b: "Continue with this project."
 nf_SAV.6.b.tt: "More time will be spent honing on the flamethrowers design."

 nf_SAV.7.t: "Further Designs"
 nf_SAV.7.d: "With more time dedicated to further honing the effectiveness of the original flamethrower design made all the way back in 2014, a further effective design has been produced. Although still cobbled together from scrap and spare components laying around, the flamethrower has shown to be more vastly reliable than previous production iterations, whilst fuel consumption is always a prevalent issue its design allows for the easy replacement of fuelant."
 nf_SAV.7.a: "We shall put these to good use."

 nf_SAV.8.t: "Formation of the Savyolovskaya Commonwealth"
 nf_SAV.8.d: "The march towards unity has bore its fruits, and today our stations have convened together to form a commonwealth of mutual economic and military interest."
 nf_SAV.8.a: "This is a glorious day!"

 nf_SAV_trade.1.t: "Traders of Mendelevskaya"
 nf_SAV_trade.1.d: "Though cut in two pieces by the Koltsevskaya Line, the Alliance had managed to broker an accord with the station of Mendelevskaya for free passage through their station, and enjoy many of the stations wares. However within recent months with the growing centralization of the Hanza, it seems Mendelevskaya is all but probably to be annexed into the alliance. We may no longer enjoy the un-taxed benefits which the Hanza most likely would take full advantage of."
 nf_SAV_trade.1.a: "Good to note."

 nf_SAV_dimitrovskaya.1.t: "Exploration of Dimitrovskaya"
 nf_SAV_dimitrovskaya.1.d: "Our Sorties have cleared Dimitrovskaya of any threats which might stifle our colonization efforts. The station remains abandoned, with no signs of recent activity or even the frequently seen oversized rat. Mutants seem eerily vacant, with own the wreckage of abandoned abodes left standing along the station platforms. Our soldiers are well on their way to fashioning barricades, and locking down the station for future recolonizing attempts by our populace."
 nf_SAV_dimitrovskaya.1.a: "That's good to know."

 nf_SAV_dimitrovskaya.2.t: "Repopulation of Dimitrovskaya"
 nf_SAV_dimitrovskaya.2.d: "With the repopulation of Dimitrovskaya underway, the new station populace is taking their newfound environment well. No sign of rats nor mutants are in sight, as odd as it seems. The ruined wreckages of abandoned abodes still left relatively in tact for our population to repurpose."
 nf_SAV_dimitrovskaya.2.a: "Everything seems to be going well."

 nf_SAV_dimitrovskaya.3.t: "Cries of the Damned"
 nf_SAV_dimitrovskaya.3.d: "Dimitrovskaya has earned a far less reputable reputation in recent months. Obviously the tales and stories of the rat hordes have come, and gone and the dark damp hallways and station platforms hold a myriad of ghost stories and tales meant to scare disobedient children, but it seems even the whole populace have been whisked into a frenzy.\n\nReports entail the noise of drums, and a sickly red haze can be seen from the tunnel leading into Timiryazevskaya, and if you are quiet enough the deep hum of chanting can also be faintly heard coming from that wretched abandoned station. Our citizens chose to not travel alone, and prefer to stay close near the few scant lit campfires; straying far from the dark."
 nf_SAV_dimitrovskaya.3.a: "This unfolding situation must be resolved, and fast."
 nf_SAV_dimitrovskaya.3.a.tt: "Unlocks Screams from Timiryazevskaya Focus Branch"

 nf_SAV_dimitrovskaya.4.t: "Kidnappings at Dimitrovskaya"
 nf_SAV_dimitrovskaya.4.d: "Reports have flooded in of Kidnappings at Dimitrovskaya Station. After reports if disappearances of citizens were at first considered due to preying mutants or folks silently fleeing to better ventures, it seems these too have more insidious causes.\n\nWithin the span of a few weeks, almost a dozen of our citizens have gone missing, some even seemingly plucked from their tents and abodes in the middle of the night as if kidnapped. Our garrison are working extended shifts to cover the futile search attempts."
 nf_SAV_dimitrovskaya.4.a: "This charade of satanic panic ends here!"
 nf_SAV_dimitrovskaya.4.a.tt: "Allows us to pursue No Saint nor Sinners focus, giving us a War Goal against the Satanists"

 nf_SAV_puppet.1.t: "[SAV.GetName] Demands subjugation"
 nf_SAV_puppet.1.d: "[SAV.GetName] Has sent us an ultimatum; Become their subject and permit our administration to kowtow to their regime, or face economic and potentially military action if we refuse."
 nf_SAV_puppet.1.a: "We must submit to their will."
 nf_SAV_puppet.1.b: "We won't bow to no one!"

 nf_SAV_puppet.2.t: "[From.GetName] Refuses Ultimatum"
 nf_SAV_puppet.2.d: "[From.GetName] Has refused our demand to become our subject. How inconsiderate."
 nf_SAV_puppet.2.a: "They will learn to regret their decision."

 nf_SAV_politics.1.t: "Unsteady Horizons"
 nf_SAV_politics.1.d: "With growing tension, and many issues facing Alliance, many doubt our capacity to keep grips upon the situation and hold the Alliance together as one. Although these rumours are relegated to simple locker-talk and would never dare publicly show their displeasure, the growing sullen atmosphere indicates eventually these issues will be brought to light. Vasyurkov has a long road ahead of him, if he is to bore fruits of his efforts."
 nf_SAV_politics.1.a: "Things will get better.. Won't they?"

 nf_SAV_politics.2.t: "Electing a new Official"
 nf_SAV_politics.2.d: "The decision to replace Vasyurkov has been set in motion, and now its to be decided who should replace him. Abramov, the station chief of Tsvetnoy Boulevard is content with running the many shady establishments of his station, leaving the decision of who should govern the Alliance strictly upon the figureheads upon Savyolovskaya. Three potent candidates are the most suitable to take on the mantle of leadership."
 nf_SAV_politics_2.a: "Makharadze"
 nf_SAV_politics_2.b: "Ishchuk"
 nf_SAV_politics_2.c: "Reznitsyn"

 nf_SAV_politics.3.t: "Violation of Trust"
 nf_SAV_politics.3.d: "Talk abound regarding Vasyurkov and the private life of his wife is circulating like wildfire across Savyolovskaya. Tales of his Wifes Infidelity have always been apparent, but it seems they have grown to be the ammunition of many of our leaders detractors. Stories of secret-meetings and love affairs have now quickly grown to become the subject of scrutiny and damage to Vasyurkov public perception.\n\nOpponents inparticular fan these snide remarks, calling that a leader who cannot control their own household may not be fit to control the Alliance."
 nf_SAV_politics.3.a: "Childish gossip will not hamper our decisions"

 nf_SAV_politics.4.t: "Doubt in the Alliance"
 nf_SAV_politics.4.d: "Following recent strife following Vasyurkovs governance of the Alliance, opposing views to his reign have been amplified. With few even raising doubts about his competency to navigate the Alliance forwards, and keeping it from fully collapsing. These public voices have become too loud to fully ignore."
