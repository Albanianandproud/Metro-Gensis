Well, half true at the very least. They did however indeed manage to fabricate humanoid machines. One android... Or rather their diggers had unearthed one; During a routine excavation mission. Laying there underneath a chunk of earth and scrap and a blanket of ice. Whether pre-war or built after the apocalypse the Aviators were unsure. The machine could speak although only in fragmented bits and pieces of German - unintelligible to their technicians. Of course, the Aviators had formerly sought to sell the Android off to the Reich, but whether as a gesture of goodwill, or just a way to quickly get it off their hands they gave ownership of the Machine to us. Seemingly endorsed too by the machine."

The European Nation needs a leader.\n\nDirectly choosing his protege, Amsel past is blanketed in rumours. All that is known that her father was a former apparatchik for the DDR before its fall. Whatever the truth may be, Amsel has shown to be highly competent and highly pledged towards the revival of the DDR."
