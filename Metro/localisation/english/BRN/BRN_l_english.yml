 ## Focuses  ##

  BRN_1: "Strengthening the Militia"

  BRN_2: "Scrounging around"
  BRN_2_desc: "Although [BRN.GetName] has few means to produce its own firearms, the few tradesmen who dabble in arms trading may be convinced to expand their operations into repairing and refitting arms. For a small fee, of course."
  BRN_3: "Patrolling the Tunnel - A Wish for nuclear summer"
  BRN_3_desc: "The passage leading to the Ring line as one would expect is choked to the brim with defense fortifications and patrolled heavily by Hanza forces. Tough to talk, and taking no shit from anyone. Perhaps theres a thing or two to learn from watching them."
  BRN_4: "Tunnel Armories"
  BRN_4_desc: "Off the tracks leading into Dinamo there is a corridor which leads into an armory choked full of guns and armaments in case they are ever needed."
  BRN_5: "Procuring Tools"
  BRN_5_desc: "The right tool for the job is the difference between Serviceable, and a pile of rusted scrap."
  BRN_6: "The First Workstations"
  BRN_6_desc: "It took a bitch and a half to get here, and the trolly buckled and broke its wheel on the way here, but it was worth the hassle. The first, hopefully of many workstations will be established, giving a place for our gunsmiths to get on unimpeded."
  BRN_7: "Sparing no Spares"
  BRN_7_desc: "Every bit of spare from rusty cords and nails to hollow tubes and bits of rotting wood can be used to aid our technicians."
  BRN_8: "Installing new Emplacements"
  BRN_8_desc: "The last time our machine guns were fired was on accident, and the time before that towards an oversized rat. Though it pays to be cautious, our guns are terrible ill-maintained and are screaming for repaired parts."
  BRN_8A: "Purchasing Power"
  BRN_8A_desc: "Sometimes the Hanseatic Borderguards may try to sell us their old machine-guns during their unusually short smoke breaks at a significantly marked up price. Keeping good relations with the Hanza is pertinent for when the occasional highly important individual might need a fast pass into the Hanza. It takes a few eggs to crack an omelette..."
  BRN_9: "Checkpoint Measures"

  BRN_10: "Technician Commune"

  BRN_11: "Community Planning"
  BRN_11_desc: "We still have a lot of unused space in the station. Whether it be for future projects, or places to store materials or designation for humble abodes. We should crack on with making more space, and planning for the future."

  BRN_14: "Community Efforts"

  BRN_15: "Teamster Unions"
  BRN_15_desc: "Due to our construction and production reaching a reasonable quantity, we must now organize and authorize their efforts through the use of a Teamsters’ Office, as we only have so much space and resources, so this is a necessity."
  BRN_16: "Community Workshops"
  BRN_16_desc: "Designating a place where our managers may come, and make quotas for resources or work as needed will go a long way to improve our stations image. Perhaps we may even get the station tiles scrubbed?"
  BRN_16A: "The Grand Bazaar"
  BRN_16A_desc: "You can buy just about anything at the station, and with its reputation traders come far for a chance to peddle, buy or haggle for wares. Even from outside the subways itself."

  BRN_17_desc: "With our current predictions, we are bound to run into production standstills or disruptions in our construction efforts. We must massively expand the workshops we have."
  BRN_17A: "Trading with Hanza Merchants"
  BRN_17A_desc: "Very rare is it to see a Hanseatic Merchant at our station, but when they are the community is abuzz. The occasional merchants from the Ring we find trade in pre-war armaments. Many of which unfired and still sitting in the manufacturing box in which it came."
  BRN_18: "Organizing the Economy"
  BRN_18_desc: "Dispensing rations, managing daily quotas and ensuring everyone is without complaint or issue is a difficult, but a managable task to accomplish."
  BRN_19: "Manager-Oriented Community"
  BRN_19_desc: "At [BRN.Capital.GetName], station administration runs hand-in-hand  with the local traders, who are dubbed as «managers». Everyone has a voice, and part to play, at least the most economically well of managers."
  BRN_20: "Satiating Finer Tastes"
  BRN_20_desc: "The tender touch of flesh, and ecstasy of warmth is the best thing any lonely soul may want, for a fee of course."
  BRN_21: "Disease Prevention"
  BRN_21_desc: "Makeshift Clinics, and tents designated for the infirm may be used to treat minor illnesses in the station."

  BRN_27_desc: "As the saying goes... One mans trash..."
  BRN_28: "Electronics"
  BRN_28_desc: "Old radios can still be of use, even if no communications have been made outside of Moscow."
  BRN_29: "Manning the Garrison"
  BRN_29_desc: "Obviously not anyone can roll up to the gate and enter. Mutants, Human-Mutants and Foreigners especially. Though Foreigners are becoming less and less prevalent as the days go on. The checkpoint is constantly manned from the able bodied populace. Each week those draw twigs, and those who get the furthest duties from the station entrance are picked. Sometimes the shortest twig, others the longest."
  BRN_30: "Our Little Hanseatic League"
  BRN_30_desc: "Those without permit, or passports to trade with the Hanza can be found at our station. Dregs to some, exotic and potential business partners to us."
  BRN_31: "From [RED.capital.GetName], with Love"
  BRN_31_desc: "Runaway political fugitives from the Redline may seek temporary asylum, only shoot their shot at entering the Hanza. So far nil have managed to get through the checkpoint, let alone hide out for more than several days before being dragged back to the Sokol kicking and screaming.\nOccasionally a Redline Stalker may seek temporary respite and restock filters, but such a sight is incredibly rare."
  BRN_32: "The Gutter Syndicate"
  BRN_32_desc: "As one would expect, Bandits and convicts too make [BRN.capital.GetName] their own. With their simple schemes and meagre rackets far too insignificant for our administration to crack down. Though too the occasional attempt to smuggle contraband across the Hanza."
  BRN_33: "From the Heart of Darkness"
  BRN_33_desc: "Even soldiers of the Reich can be found at [BRN.capital.GetName], Depositing their bullet rations at our bank or browsing the many exotic wares for sale. Economic trade doesn't always have to be political."
  BRN_34: "Coercive Labour"
  BRN_34_desc: "Unemployment is virtually nil at [BRN.capital.GetName]. Unlike other stations where the homeless and sick line the station gutters, our platforms are left well kept. Those who stay jobless for long seem to move to places elsewhere, almost as if they got up and left in a hurry. Without a trace."
  BRN_35: "Rags and Riches"
  BRN_35_desc: "Mutants are thankfully not a problem. With the majority of the population barring virtually none genetic deformities the fear of mutant men among us remains slim. Those merchants who arrive draped in rags and refuse to take off their respirators at the checkpoint however arouse some suspicion. If it weren't for their decent wares, and pockets full of bullets they'd of been ousted already."
  BRN_36: "Assailing the Surface"
  BRN_36_desc: "Now is the time. Our military has grown, and we have enough expertise across the station to begin the creation of our very own Stalkers."
  BRN_37: "Guiding our Station"

 ## Events ##

  nf_BRN.1.t: "Werwolf"
  nf_BRN.1.d: "Sometimes we might get the infrequent Reich soldier or stalker at our station, waiting for orders back from Tverskaya. Sometimes orders arrive from other arriving soldiers or even station informants. However one Reich soldier has been waiting, and waiting for orders to return. Its been close to a year now, still no assignments. He'd quickly return to base, if it weren't the increasingly tightening standards of the Reich. Undoubtedly, he would fail."
  nf_BRN.1.a: "Perhaps he might be inclined to serve our station?"
  nf_BRN.1.b: "There's always the odd job you may do, to bide your time."
  nf_BRN.2.t: "Relax, Take it Easy"
  nf_BRN.2.d: "An retired prospector resides at our station. Spending his old years post-war looking for work, or the occasional bit of scrap or electronics to sell, but when he got too old soon retired. He still keeps a large stash of dynamite locked away in his quarters, a rather sizable arsenal if we are to believe. Perhaps with some convincing we might persuade him to give them up?"
  nf_BRN.2.a: "Out of retirement, just for a while longer..."
  nf_BRN.2.b: "Take it easy, Easy Pyotr."
  nf_BRN.3.t: "The Three Tankists"
  nf_BRN.3.d: "The infrequent rail cart arrives to our station, Not staying for long and only making frugal purchases from the markets. From word of our soldiers, and traders who have managed to get more than several terse words from them they are former Redline soldiers, disillusioned with the regime in [RED.Capital.GetName], and sought it out on their own path. Then soon enough became disillusioned with the revolutionists, who they worked alongside. They now roam the Metro in their makeshift trolly, serving whoever pays well enough, fighting off the urge to revert to simply banditry and thuggery to make a living. Perhaps they might find a home, and service here."
  nf_BRN.3.a: "A mobile brigade? We could use one of those..."
  nf_BRN.3.b: "Their purchases serve us more than adequately."
  nf_BRN.4.t: "Dreams of Cruelty"
  nf_BRN.4.d: "A vagrant lives in the tunnels, catching the occasional oversized rodent to sell as food to our butchers. While its a good thing that the rat population has been kept in check thanks to them, the ghastly sight and smell of him remains to be thankful for. Thought to be feral, or a wildman at first sight it became clear from the tattered rags and stencilled markings on its stained outfit they were a former satanist. Beneath its drunk and slurring grunts, one has to shudder what remains beneath the cowl. What dreams do he have of chronic and continuous cruelty that even Satanists would fear? Glad he's on our side."
  nf_BRN.4.a: "If it keeps the mutants at bay..."
  nf_BRN.4.b: "Perhaps the furthest stretches of the tunnels suit  you better."
  nf_BRN.5.t: "Ratmen?"
  nf_BRN.5.d: "Sometimes a secret if worth far more than a handful of bullets. Two foreign traders were held in custody by our forces under the suspicion of being mutants. They had been routine traders, coming to the station every other week or so to purchase food, or the odd book on sale. After a spat, where the traders refused to take off their respirators and show their faces to the authority they were held. After terse back and forth with our administration, in fear of word of traders getting kicked in would spread like wildfire and deter customers they were soon released."
  nf_BRN.5.a: "Perhaps some of their soldiers may be of service."
  nf_BRN.5.b: "Their trade is fine enough."
  nf_BRN.6.t: "Expanding the Military Committee"
  nf_BRN.6.d: "With our meagre military forces stretched as far as they can tangibly go and the black cloud of future conflict looming ever so closer, we may have to turn to an unconventional solution. Drawn with the promise of fortune, these seasoned warriors from across the Metro shall answer our call. For a small fee. Some may disapprove with this, filling our own command roster with those who swear no allegiance beyond the prospect of bullets. Regardless, they are a vital source of experience we desperately need."
  nf_BRN.6.a: "Their loyalty can be turned aside, for bullets of course."
