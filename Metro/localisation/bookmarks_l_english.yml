 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "It has been 15 years since the day of Armageddon. On that fateful day humanity drew its last breath and casted itself into extinction. With the remnants taking refuge within the dark and dingy tunnels and systems which comprise the Moscow Metro. Cultivating its own law and governance within each station. While safe from the nuclear obliteration on the surface, the constant state of perpetual war, mutant infestations and now reports of an insidious menace stirring within the decrepit dakrness. Does Humanity have any hope of survival?"

 HNZ_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Hanza is a Capitalist Alliance of independant stations, which has completely subjugated the Ring Line, and boasts huge political and economic clout within the Metro. Peacefully trading with many neutral stations.\n However this almighty status would have not been without conflict; The bloody and ruthless Hanza-Redline War in the 2020s, paying the bloodprice personally for the war. While peace was achieved, it did little to quell the flames, with tensions slowly, but surely stirring all across the Metro. A major conflict will come. With Hanza being at its epicenter. Whether they like to or not."
