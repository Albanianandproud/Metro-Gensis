 global_event.1.d:0 "Whilst battles still continue to rage on elsewhere in [PLS.GetNameDef], reports have come in that [Root.GetNameDef] have captured the station of [361.GetName]. Stalkers, Military personnel and citizens alike made a valliant attempt to smuggle out books belonging to the great repositories of knowledge safeguarded over the years. As fires burnt, smouldering up most of the stores only a handful of books were managed to be saved, the rest burnt to cinders.\n\nThe Great council chamber, which in times passed served as the negotiating point between Communist and Anti-Communist forces alike, now burns admist the backdrop of strife."

 global_event.2.d:0 "[Root.GetNameDef] Have confirmed they have managed to take the station of [304.GetName] today. As arms-fire can still be heard across the station, no significant Hanseatic counter-attack has yet been confirmed. Many Hanseatic soldiers making the ultimate sacrifice in the defense of [304.GetName], or simply allowing the escape of the stations more wealthier occupants to occur. Precious trinkets still line the walls, and  gutter up the tracks. Reports of [Root.GetNameDef] troops making off with war spoils and crates of military-grade bullets are unconfirmed, however. [304.GetName] is left in a heavily damaged state, and will take a incredibly long time to see the same levels of affluence it once had."

 global_event.3.t:0 "[275.GetName] Burns"
 global_event.3.d:0 "Despite Reich denial, the capture of [275.GetName] has been confirmed. With fighting described as tense, and the bodies littering the floor. The Dark Heart of the Reich has been broken. Fighting tooth and nail and laughing in the face of defeat, Reich soldiers stood and braced against the assailing forces. Despite fierce resistance, and even uncomfirmed reports of suicide bombing attempts by some ideologically fanatical Reich troops, they were pushed back out from [275.GetName].\n\nAs fighting has calmed down across the station, [Root.GetNameDef] have already began the attempt at De-Nazifying the station. Banners burnt and trodded on by celebrating troops, and Triskeles smashed to the floor. Just under a hundred years ago, the Reich was defeated by brave Russian souls, and now it has happened again."
 global_event.3.a:0 "The Reich will stand 'til the last man. To its last breath! Sieg!"
 global_event.3.b:0 "With the counterattack, everything will be alright... right?"
 global_event.3.c:0 "The Reich has Fallen, and so too shall the Fuhrer!"

 global_event.4.t:0 "Siege of [330.GetName]"
 global_event.4.d:0 "At dawn, [Root.GetNameDef] troops smashed through the established bulwark of Redline Troops, and pushed into [330.GetName] proper.\n Thick billowing smoke poured across the station as fires loomed as the attacking soldiers stormed through. NKVD soldiers, alongside a small group of Redline Conscripts converted the Bolshoi theater into a fortress, but were ultimately forced out from the usage of explosives and flamethrower teams. Whilst some commissar holdouts still maintain control of some sections of the station, for the most part the battle for [330.GetName] seems to be drawing to its conclusion.\n\nDespite staunch orders from [RED.GetLeader] to deny citizens to retreat once fighting commenced, exceptions were made to Women, Children and many of the theater performers. Managing to slip out and escape well before the fighting gripped the station, however with their parent station in ruins. Performances have permanently been postponned."

 global_event.7.d:0 "After hours of intense room-to-room combat, [Root.GetNameDef] has confirmed they have for the most part captured the station of [308.GetName]. Whilst a few sections of the station have yet to be properly cleared, Hanseatic Troops despite their valliant effort were forced to withdraw entirely from the station. Not without a bloody struggle however, as hastily erected barbed wire fields and improvised nail IEDs covered their tracks, which came at tremendous losses to both sides.\n\nDespite as the rattling of rifle rounds which can still be heard pinging off from the walls further down the Metro tunnel, an eerie silence falls upon whats left of [308.GetName]. Its only listeners are the corpses of its defenders."

Its economic affluence was once apparent, but now muchb of station tracks and central boulevard lay in ruins. Whilst much of the stations resources and economic assets were evacuated before fighting broke through into the station proper, a sudden fire had whisked much of the items to irreversable ruin. What scraps are left being picked off as war trophies by jubliant [Root.GetNameDef] forces. The Hanseatic League are yet to make a full statement regarding the fall."
