 nf_metro.1.d:0 "Welcome to the Metro HOI4 Mod. Currently the mod is in Early Alpha stage of Developement. As of the initial release, the mod is being worked on by a single developer. So keep that in mind when encountering any of the numerous bugs, game breaking issues other such unintended hijinks. Updates and fixes should be gradually rolled out over time. With decent content updates hopefully rolling out every other week or so. \n If you encounter any bugs or glitches, please let it be known in the Discord or through Steam. Or if you want to give suggestions or constructive criticism. Anything is Appreciated. \n Hope you enjoy the mod! \n- Albanian."
