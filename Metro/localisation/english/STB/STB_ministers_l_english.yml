 STB_STORTBEKER_DESC:0 "What seperates the disciplined structured order of the Reich, and the savage hordes of mutant beasts or communists is where their loyalty lies. Some to ideology, others bound only to see the world cast of degeneracy. Whilst others crave power and fortune. Even to many amongst the ranks of the Reich, who spit phlegm and swear over his name being passed.\n\nReknowned for his cunning aplitude and most importantly, his results. He is craven and cruel, commandeering even more depraved soldiers than himself.\n\nConvicted criminals of the Reich, or punished former soldiers of the Metromacht who have been sent to Stortbekers brigade and not expected to ever return to the confines of the Reich. Instead however Stortbeker has coddled, or rather sparked a flame inside each one. Something far more insidious and far more wicked than even the spoused dogma from the Propaganda Ministry could coin up."
