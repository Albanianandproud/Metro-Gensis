  HNZ_invisible_observer: "Moscow Defence Council"
  HNZ_russia_government_remnants: "Muscovite Remnants"

  HNZ_kovalenko: "Denis Kovalenko"
  HNZ_kovalenko_desc: "§9«Time had laid hands upon his greying hairs, but had left his mind be. Carrying age like a scholar may carry books. For battle scars were worn like gleaming medals from a war fading into distant memory.»§!\n\nFormer head of Komsomolskaya station, and currently serving as the first acting president of the Unified Commonwealth of the Ring Line, Kovalenko was unanimously hailed as a hero by Anti-Communist forces for his savy political skill. His bold act to broker a temporary ceasefile with the Redline to save the lives of encircled soldiers in Komsomolskaya-Radialnaya. Eventually going on to broker the first terms of peace, a hallmark which all but guarenteed his candidacy for presidentship.\n\n"

  HNZ_zvorykine: "Vladislav Zvorykine"
  HNZ_zvorykine_desc: "§9«Tall, gaunt with a shaved head and an uncompromising air, he is a family man just over fifty, steeped in puritanical morals, religious in his own way.»§!\n\nRecently rising to power to become the acting president of the Hanseatic League, Zvorykin seeks to lead the commonwealth down an unexpected path. One of maximizing profit and aggressive optimization rather than humble ambivalence. Yet stern expression, lack of humor and constant drive to focus on only the important political matters has an undeniable magnetism which commands an audience. If the devil himself was to ever present a trick to improve productivity, there's no doubt Zvorykin wouldn't hesitate for a second."

  HNZ_loginov:0 "Valeri Petrovich Loginov"
  HNZ_LOGINOV_DESC:0 "The Current residing President of the Commonwealth of the Ring Line. Under his watch, he guides the relatively young Inter-stational Commonwealth through the tricky politicking of the metro. But under his careful composure is a broken man haunted by the souls of those who he gave a false hope of asylum to during the bloody Hanza-Redline war. Whilst this decision to hand over so called «anti-revolutionary dissenters, to the Red line, to spare his own troops was the catalyst to propel his political career. This grim truth is little more than glossed over. With the blood of men, women and children still staining his hands to this day."

  HNZ_whataburger_will_desc:0 "Hailing from the United States, he is often at times seen as benign and amiable. A soft-spoken man, despite his extensive knowledge in jurry-rigged firearms and retrofitted small-arms.

Although folks distrust him for his nationality; the same nation of which instigated World War 3."

  ## Advisors ##

  HNZ_foreign_soldier: "Rutger De Vries"
  HNZ_FOREIGN_SOLDIER_DESC: "De Vries, a man who would've found himself fighting against the country which gave him refuge if the war hadn't broken out. Hailng from the Netherlands, this manner-of-fact spoken former Mercenary had numerous tours beneath his belt; from the windswept craggy hills of Papua New Guinea, to the deek dark heart of the Congo and desolate wastes of Afghanistan. Rutger De Vries takes the wisdom he has collected from one chaotic war to the next. Where there is war, theres profit to be made,and De Vries will be sure he has a stake at the table.

Tales and past exploits fill his retinue between speeches, so much so its almost difficult to fully believe. Through the bleak thickness of battle behind communist lines during the Hanza-Redline Wars, to staring a Demon straight in the eyes with nothing but a half-spent cartridge and living to tell the tale. Bochkarev could be considered a badass."

  HNZ_dedushka: "Sergei Yasnov"
  HNZ_DEDUSHKA_DESC: "if it isn't already obvious why his squad officially bestowed the title of «Dedushka» to Yasnov, discovering his age will paint a perfect picture as to war. Serving with distinction during the Chechen Wars, with old age arrives wisdom and Yasnov is certainly fitting the bill. More than missing the world that was before, he misses the fray. The rush of adrenaline in the thickness of battle. The snarling bullets and rain of lead. Returning to give war one final spur, and to teach his wisdom seems a better fit than choosing to retreat into some tent, and live out his days quietly before he finally hits the hay."
