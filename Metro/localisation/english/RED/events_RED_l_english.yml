 nf_RED.1.d:0 "Its by no mere chance that the Red Line sprouted from the Sokolnicheskaya line. Every edifice and facade of the line is finely detailed with statues of Stalin, Lenin and other Socialist heroes. Monuments of once-revered saints lay as a surviving testament to the world before. Like Egyptian Tombs of yore, their ephemeral aura of power drew in those far and wide; pilgrims to witness what was and to pay their respect. Over a period of time that awe became reverence, and finally devotion. With the world as we knew gone, and only those faded memories of the past existed. It gave hope; an opportunity to build a new socialist bastion, unshackled from the burdens of the past.\n\nSurving Komsomol figures and those who lived under the reign of socialism began to put in motion a socialist revival. Overthrowing local stations and installing revolutionary councils across the Sokolnicheskaya, declaring a first Interstational; their goal, uniting the entire metro under Communism. Andrey Moskvin was one such revolutionary, his robustness and vigour personally spearheading the revolution and soon found himself overseeing the newly-established revolution."

 nf_RED.2.d:0 "However, what first began as social upheaval became a full-scale war with the rest of the metro. Many stations opposed the desires of the newly-established Red Line. Those on an ideological basis. Capitalist stations and others opposed to the workers revolution. The forming station-state of the Hanseatic League, diametrically opposed the Red Line, leading a coalition of stations to fight against the firebrand of the Revolution. Thusly started one of the bloodiest conflicts in the entire Metro. Bodies plunged into the meat grinder, and precious rescourse churned for the war effort. The decrepit state of the Metro can be largely attributed to this war alone. A stalemate of attritional warfare, with neither side yielding, but giving it their all, and thus becoming weaker as the war elapsed. As the realisation that the dream of a united Metro under socialism was fading, unrest and mutinies began to arise from within. Ideological differences spurred on full-scale insurrection, those leaving the fight and establishing their own stations, weakening the Red Lines support for the war in the process."

 nf_RED.3.d:0 "As the war dragged on furtherm neither the Red Line, or the Hanza saw the possibility of victory against the other. Pouring every resource they could scrap to kill, maim and destroy the other side with the end result being the innevitable decay of both parties. As both nations began to crumble and rot from the inside from exhaustion. citizens and soldiers alike protesting against the war. Too arrogant to kneel to the mob, either side were unyielding to submit to a peace agreement. If the deal was unfavourable to the ideologcally-die hard amongst the ranks of each, it could lead to further disharm and spur more instability. Bot sides were too stubborn to come to peace, and only wished to proclaim a victory against the other.\n\nEventually however, peace was arranged in absolute secret. Eventually, Andrey came to realize the war could never be won against the Coalition. With every victory piled up bodies, more wasted resources. Was this really the price to pay for socialism? However peace was not his initial agreement. It was not even his dismay over the war, it was infact his brothers own personal drive to declare peace.\n\nHis Younger brother, Maxim Moskvin, who oversaw the peace talks, at first without Andrey's knowledge. The deal commenced; Ploshchad Revolyutsii was to be given to the Red Line from Arbat. Arbat received the Biblioteka Imeni Lenina with eventually was handed over to Polis. A guarentee of free-access was agreed upon by all parties. The Red Line was cut in half. Andrey was championed by the people and the party alike for the peace. The inner circle of 'hard-blooded' socialists scorn at what they deemed a 'betrayal' of the revolution. Whilst all became unknowing that it was Andrey's own brother, Maxim being the true negotiator of peace. His feat hidden amongst the shadow. A starting point which planted his brothers growing resentment towards him."

 nf_RED.4.d:0 "Andrey, a member of the revolutionary council, now saw himself as the General Secretary of the Red Line. Despite there being other competitors to that mantle, his will and tenacity saw him take to the mantle of leadership. His rule soon became unquestioned. However, now in 2028 as the ashes of the Hanseatic-Redline conflict begin to settle. The Red Line finds itself ever increasingly sliding into a more dire situation. The Sokolnicheskaya finds itself in a  precarious position which must be adressed with delicate hands. Many issues plague the nation, more within than without. The economy has grown stagnant; a policy of confiscation of resources levied to supply our military is still practised, making our economy unable to grow and develop from a subsistence basis. Neglect over the governments willingness to handle this, spurred on by the military's bloated control over all facets of business and daily industry has spiraled into the commonfolk slowly detesting the local powers which be. Even with hushed whispers against the state itself. These issues have only grown and festered in recent months.\n\nThis is not the only problems to face us however. The Fascists pigs of Tverskaya have recently become invigorated thanks to their new Fuhrer. Scuffles on the tunnels between us has only increased from sporadic conflicts within recent weeks. Like the Great Patriotic War of old, we once fought and defeated them like. But it took a great deal of sacrifice. A monumental effort of blood and iron. Something way may not be able to affort right now.\n\nBut we must remind ourselves this General Secretary. We are the heirs of the Soviet Socialist Union. Lenin's will will not snuffed out!"

Most resources which haven't been allocated to the Military, or distributed to our R&D is used to resuscitate our stagnant economy. A more direct approach is needed; instead of resources being spent to just 'patch up' the bloating issue, a new method is needed.\n\n Two solutions have been proposed. Firstly is the implementation of grants and other schemes aimed towards improving our station adimistrations effectiveness at handling local issues. Secondly a more fundamental solution is prioritising funds aimed at growing our primary industries such as construction and farming. Being able to be self sufficient and support itself and future growth."

 nf_RED.6.d:0 "Our military. Once before the war the Soviet Union had one of the biggest and strongest armies in the entire world. Its armed forces were equipped with the latest and deadliest weapons of war, and drilled second to none. From the Taiga of Siberia to the Baltics Russia was supreme. The Army both protected, and preserved its workers and ideals. But now today it seems that is the other way around\n\n Through a long line of inner decay the military has slowly withered and fractured to bickering factions within the Military. Despite the sheer volume of manpower at its disposal the lack of proper training procedures, and even pressing disregard for any combined communication between commanders ensures the military remains isolated and bloated. Poor logistics and not to mention the severe corruption which is profoundly showcased with the high command. Outfitted in regalia and adorned with dozens of medals, most of which had not been awarded, but snatched from traders or scavenged. A military not of merit or skill but of arrogance, parading as generals."

 nf_RED.7.d:0 "Grain requesitioning is a double-edged sword. Provding our troops with the much needed supplies in times of strife such as the Hansa war. A war exclusively fought in little pockets ande distraught all across the metro. Supplies being moved to and from, by an organized method was difficult given the linear nature of the war. So the Army resorted to confiscating grain and other resources to boost their stocks.\n\n Whilst this indeed proved successful, it did however be too efficient. A reliance upon this tried-and true method persisted. However despite the war becoming a distant memory the Military still practises it to this day. One contributing factor as to why our economy is in such a slump.\n\n It'd be wise to demobilise our rate of conviscation, however its reliance upon times of War is not to be questioned, nor is it something to avoid when war does indeed becomes clear."

Andreys charm, his success and power. A brotherly relationship rotted and no more than simple rivalry.\n\n Was there any respect Maxim held for his older brother? Hard to tell, but that love had been weathered and had withered away over the years to nothing. The only memories Maxim could give of their youth wasn't the bond they once shared, careless children but the bitter resentment he held.\n\n Despite this, Moskvin holds to him his own talents. He may never be anything like is more talented brother. But Maxim holds to him a resolve that few could attain. A strong brow, and an unquestioned authority few could dare to go against. Self confidence and true to ones self. Arrogance? possibly, but someone to lead, a figurehead."

Taking his most loyal soldiers into the deep recesses of the Metro to setup a base of operations to command and direct distraught cells of agitators.\n\nCaught between the crossfire, ordinary everyday soldiers and militias are stranded. As soldiers desert their posts, others take up arms and are cordoning entrances to and from stations. Blocking vital trade and access of people.

Many of its members former Russian State Security personnel, with even a handful being former KGB members during Russias Communist days.

He has a built himself a ample reputation amongst the lower commanders. Idolized as a popular figurehead within the military. Viktor Kovshov was once a man who had nothing but respect for Andrey. It was him alone, with his reputation underneath his belt which ensured Andrey his current position of power. Kovshov is a die-hard communist much alike Moskvin, and the two ideals co-align. However Kovshov firmly believes in the power of the sword, whilst Andrey with recent years believing more so in the capabilities of the pen itself.\n\nKovshov staunchly believes that the Red Line at its current state is able to contest and fight against the Hansa. Hansa is weak, and inefficient at completely holding the ring line itself. Only through lightning action and conflict can the Red Line preserve its position. It is boxed in, corned by foes all around. Kovshov also insists upon removing, or limiting power the fickle politburo. With a personal grudge for pencil-pushers and other bureaucrats. His ire drawn towards the Central Metro Command in its early days, joining Andreys revolt against the inefficient CMC.\n\nViktor is not too keen upon these recent changes, to say the least. Removing the influence of the military and replacing it with a centralised power structure which answers the general secretariat and his officials. No longer two entities but inseperable. Kovshov fears, like from history past. First, Perestroika, then Glasnot and finally the state crumbles under a tide of uncertainty. If... and when the government will stray away from its own ideals.

Any traces of their legacy ruthlessly quashed. Their bodies burned as not to inspire any acts of martyrdom.

Even giving them an inch, they'd take it for a mile. But like always they'd keep wanting and wanting. So it was decided to arrange a meeting with the leaders of the demonstrators. It wasn't particularly difficult to track down the figureheads. Although at first their reluctance for meeting made it almost appear as the plan would fail. Andreys ace card up his sleeve..."

His recent handling of the Military has only proven this. New recruits idolizing him just as much as the commonfolk would with Andrey. Maxim is not a remarkable man in his own right, but is loyalty to the Red Line is one thing. With brotherly ties between Andrey and Maxim would ensure no trechary could take place. Maxim has often suggested and wished for a position of power and influence. To lead. Assigning him as the role of General of the Armed forces could give him just that.

No more than thugs than a disciplined force, yet gouging themselves with armaments and weapons pinched from the Red Line as they turned their backs upon the Revolution for Personal profit.\n\nTheir Leader, dubbed simply as Master was once a low-ranking Officer, although recollection is still hazy and muddled. Having more of an ideological backbone - or just a fascination compared to the rest of his peers. Running his own station more like a boot-camp than a band of brigadiers. Although its clearly yet to be shown upon the tenacity of the troops. Being caught off guard by our forces. They shouldn't pose much of a threat.

A bullet must have bounced off from a nearby wall which had hit him directly in the chest. Bleeding out and succumbing to his wounds as the firefight continued to rain hell in the station. Amusingly dying as he lived; cowardly and craven.\n\nDespite their leaders passing, the bandits still continued to put up much resistance. Cordoning much of the Station and retreating to each subsequent level as Red Line forces advanced. Fears that as a last resort the bandits would collapse the whole station were put at ease, as the bandits made headway to their last redoubt. One-by-one picked off and as the last remained, only a few escapees could flee into the deep darkness of the tunnels to be never seen again."

Just the two. To sit and chat and dine like brothers. And in the end? Through it all? the schemes and underhanded play, Andrey still loved his brother no more than anything else in this world. He remembered fondly of the time the two would play together as kids. A happy youth few will remember, or would ever have again. The bond the two had, and shared had now rotted away. A festering carcass of bitterness and resentment. The glorious days in contrast with the drab room. Those days of brotherly love was gone. \n\n§tMaxim, brother! I'm so pleased that we finally made up. It was a fight over nothing. Let's have a drink!§!\n\nAs his brother raised his glass in a toast, and sipped upon the Mushroom Tea, Maxims face stood firm. Through the 20 years of struggle and toil. Of always being in his brothers shadow. The insurmountable scorn and envy he had dealt with, all manifested to this moment. But he yielded not even a flinch. Watching, observing as his brother succumbed to the poison. Gagging gasping upon the floor as Andrey gave his last dying gasps for life. Not a word."

Enemies lay all around, within and without which will snuff out the Revolution for good.\n\nMaxim's whole life was swallowed by grief and bitterness towards his brother. Always wanting something more from life, no amount of power or vanity could fill that void. He has no glory day to reminisce about, because he never found any fufillment from life.
