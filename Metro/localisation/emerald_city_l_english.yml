 emerald_city_desc:0 "University, Prospekt Vernadskogo and Yugo-Zapadnaya stations form the illusive Emerald City.The subsequent destruction of Vorobyovy Gory station and the collapsed bridge over the Moskva river has isolated the University from the rest of the Metro.\n\nIts known current extent only existing in tall tales; accounts from friends of a friend, or gossip by travelling traders; which have devolved into half-true truths and incomplete rumours. Though reports exist of stalkers encountering scientific expeditions sent from Emerald City on the surface.\n\n Whether they exist or not is up for debate. However the Red Line refuse to acknowledge even the mere notion of its existance."
