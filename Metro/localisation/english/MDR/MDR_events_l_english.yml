  nf_MDR.1.t: "Contact with Moscow"
  nf_MDR.1.d: "Greetings President [ROOT.GetLeader], under your tenure the Republic has prospered despite all odds. Your soldiers remain staunchly loyal to your cause, and through persuasion the civilian sector shall surely follow your cause. May I suggest now is the time to begin reaching out? We have heard reports that the southern stations are in fact inhabited. Not by mutants but in fact people. We do not doubt NATO and American forces still surround Moscow and much of the motherland."
  nf_MDR.1.a: "Perhaps now it is time to extend outwards, yes?"

  nf_MDR.2.t: "Colonization of [283.GetName]"
  nf_MDR.2.d: "The Reports of [283.GetName] seem to be true. Its right in front of our fucking faces, to be frank President sir. Either side of the platform lay a deep tangled web of trees and foliage. It quite literally is a jungle. God knows what foul mutants lurk within, and for one thing I'd like not to find out. Perhaps the Moles were onto something about staying the fuck away from the surface, hmm? Who am I kidding President sir, our Foresters are already making plans on setting up a permanent base on the platform proper. Providing they have enough gas masks and filters provided by our populace of course. Maybe we'll get one of those trolleys up and running so poor old Yuri doesn't break his back carrying logs to and fro, huh? It'll take a while for us to clear a path through the dense thicket... God I miss chainsaws."
  nf_MDR.2.a: "Excellent work, Soldiers."

  nf_MDR.3.t: "Colonization of [291.GetName]"
  nf_MDR.3.d: "After clearing much of the rubble we've managed to breach a small shaft through the wreckage, and on the other side the Moles managed to break through into [291.GetName] proper. I'll be clear President Sir, I fucking hate the feeling of the station. Something about seeing how just- empty this place gives me the creeps. A habitual slave turned barfly from the Cherkizon told us this place used to be inhabited once. I cannot imagine for the life of me any poor sod wanting to live here. Our Soldiers are maintaining a basic perimeter as we get the rest of the squad set. Hopefully with some elbow grease and sandbags, maybe a campfire here and some bunks over there we'll make this place real tidy in no time."
  nf_MDR.3.a: "Good Job, gentlemen."

  nf_MDR.4.t: "They're in the God-Damn Trees!"
  nf_MDR.4.d: "Its gotta be said, whichever fuck told us that there are half-animal, half-plant half whatever-the-fuck else mutants slithering out in the jungle wasn't lying through his teeth. Fuckers took out one of our soldiers earlier this morning whilst on break, sending the rest of the detachment at [283.GetName] on full-scale alert. Really wish we had some flamethrowers, or something right now."
  nf_MDR.4.a: "Its gonna take more than mutant cabbages to scare us off"

  nf_MDR.5.t: "Contact With [BAU.GetNameDef]"
  nf_MDR.5.d: "Referred simple to as the Bauman Alliance, they are a confederation of technicians and engineers who prioritise repairing pre-war electronics and equipment. Comprised of pre-war engineers and machinists, they also conduct stalker expeditions on the surface - we have encountered a few of them before in the past from afar, simple gawking to and from before the weather hits a turn for the worst. Perhaps we may extend an olive branch?"
  nf_MDR.5.a: "We'd be happy to arrange some mutual trade deal"
  nf_MDR.5.b: "Your NATO tricks are easily seen through, western scum!"

  nf_MDR.6.t: "Surface Treks"
  nf_MDR.6.d: "Other than the unending weather, and roaming packs of mutants the surface could almost be idyllic. If it weren't for the nail-biting cold almost picturesque. Thats until your geiger counter starts going haywire and before you can notice you're growing an extra arm from your chest. There's not much to be sought for collection on the surface, but the real prize is coming across any unfortunate sods who were at the mercy to the elements and subsequently perished. We found one unlucky bastard. Appearing to be dead for quite some time now, and in no state to withstand the temperature or conditions on the surface, the corpse had met its fate.  In its grubby hands appeared to be an assorted collection of papers and documents, safeguarded close to their chest."
  nf_MDR.6.a: "Research Papers"
  nf_MDR.6.b: "Weaponsmith Schematics"

  nf_MDR.7.t: "Research Institute of Epidemiology"
  nf_MDR.7.d: "Deep within the thicket of the Izmailovo jungle exists a ramshackle building. To no ones surprise, the place was already pilfered by the time we had launched the expedition. Much valuables had already been carried off, and anything left rotted from the passages of time. Most of the lab equipment is far too old and decrepit to be repaired, but with enough scouring our expedition has assured us they will bring back whatever they can find."
  nf_MDR.7.a: "Nothing much to discern, but we could do with some of this machinery"
  nf_MDR.7.b: "Research that Perhaps should be forgotten"

  nf_MDR.8.t: "Beyond the Ring Road"
  nf_MDR.8.d: "Tracing across the Scherkovskoe Road, our expedition managed to reach the far outlands of Moscow. From concrete mounds and steel ruins the landscape broke out into ramshackle houses and abandoned streets. It seems that despite Moscow received much of the initial punishment, the ecological affect of nuclear war had a lingering affect on the countryside. Still barely uninhabitable; from rampant mutants and radiation to flooding and overgrown wildlife. But one thing remains, life does persist outside of Moscow. Our scouts were hailed by fellow Muscovites."
  nf_MDR.8.a: "Villages on the far hinters of Moscow"
  nf_MDR.8.b: "Weaponsmiths Kirzhach"
  nf_MDR.8.c: "Former Military Units stranded on the outskirts"

  nf_MDR.10.t: "A House Divided"
  nf_MDR.10.d: "The Revolution has reached a tipping point. Internal disputes threaten to rip the fabric of our union into two."
  nf_MDR.10.a: "The Republic must stand"

  nf_MDR.11.t: "Conscription?"
  nf_MDR.11.d: "'You! Have you signed up with the volunteers?' Or however the propaganda posters used to go. You'd be surprised by just how many are unwilling to serve the military. Who would? Theres no heroism in sitting around all day watching as the world slowly decays around you. Sure we can incentivise folks, 'see the world' or whats left of it. But if we can't find enough people to enlist theres always alternative measures we can apply."
  nf_MDR.11.a: "Only the Willing"
  nf_MDR.11.b: "'Encourage' Conscription"
  nf_MDR.11.c: "Compulsory for the able-bodied"

  nf_MDR.12.t: "Supplies?"
  nf_MDR.12.d: "Sure we can use a tin pan as a helmet, but very few are stupid enough to be lead along with the idea a sheet of tin metal can stop heavy-calibre fire. The attempts at kitting our soldiers with the best of the best has gotten us so far, but there are only so many warehouses and depots left on the surface that haven't been picked clean. Unless we can make shit ourselves, we've gotta make do with the supplies and tat we've got laying around."
  nf_MDR.12.a: "Anything we can scavenge"
  nf_MDR.12.b: "Effort to equip our soldiers with the good-rate gear"
  nf_MDR.12.c: "Only the best will suffice"

  nf_MDR.13.t: "Rotation?"
  nf_MDR.13.d: "Being on military duty sucks. But being on military duty with no chance of return back to loved ones is a whole entire deal. Wear and fatigue hampers down on a soldier just as much as being in direct fire. Rotating soldiers from active duty to garrison duty only goes so far."
  nf_MDR.13.a: "3-Month Rotation"
  nf_MDR.13.b: "6-Month Rotation"
  nf_MDR.13.c: "12-Month Rotation"

  nf_MDR.14.t: "Payroll?"
  nf_MDR.14.d: "Its the question of most of our soldiers' lips, but few dare to ask. It's the lifeblood of our economy, and of our military after all. But considering were no longer using bank notes and the bankpayers expenses to fund our army how should we go about paying our military?"
  nf_MDR.14.a: "Soldier payment is expected, but not always guaranteed"
  nf_MDR.14.b: "Soldiers are paid directly from our Administration"
  nf_MDR.14.c: "Even after service, former soldiers should be compensated"

  nf_MDR.15.t: "Who do WE Serve?"
  nf_MDR.15.d: "The Republic, of course, but to what extent do our troops know this? Do they know what they're protecting? Without proper morals or ethics we're just a bunch of no-good thugs with cool guns and armour. More than discipline, a need for a higher purpose has to be instilled in the ranks."
  nf_MDR.15.a: "We Serve the Republic"
  nf_MDR.15.b: "We Serve the Ideas"
  nf_MDR.15.c: "People Above All Else"

  nf_MDR.16.t: "Ignorance is Bliss"
  nf_MDR.16.d: "For over a decade now, our Republic has stood firm. Russia may be gone, but Humanity still lingers on. Our populace are content, and it seems an odd notion of living has finally settled in the minds of our citizenry. However, this hasn't been without pain or strife. As much as we may spin words to keep our people well fed and happy we cannot let our populace know of the outside world. Unconfirmed reports indicate that perhaps the rest of the Metro may be inhabited by human folk. Any interactions with the other polities in the Moscow Metro must be kept hushed. Our government officials can easily conceal our operations away from the public, however eventually some of our people may invariably catch on."
  nf_MDR_16.a.tt: "If our £stability_icon §YStability§! drops below a certain threshold, or we get into a §YMajor Conflict§! with any of the powers in the Metro, our people will surely revolt against the §CRepublic§!."
  nf_MDR.16.a: "To Preserve our People"

  nf_MDR.17.t: "Discordancy in the Republic"
  nf_MDR.17.d: "Whilst the Pervomayskaya Republic is a united state, there exists two clear cut castes which ostensibly operate beneath the state. Caste membership is chosen by each citizenry of the Republic, and from there they are set in that profession for life. Over time, and unending disagreements and friction between these two sects both organizations have cultivated their own identity.\n\nThe Moles are those scout the unending Metro tunnels in search of valuable technology or electronics. Most of their operations persist underground, and carry a contemptuous stereotype of a hermetic coward by Loggers who would rather flee from an oversized rat than justifiably stomp on it.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, Woodsmen, or Loggers are those who venture upon the surface, and make forays into the Izmailovo jungle cutting down trees to make for firewood or building supplies. Some even dare trek further beyond the Moscow Ring Road, and look down upon Moles for their cowardly nature. Often boisterous and arrogant towards who they believe are inferior.\n\nThese two parties have coexisted for over a decade now, and despite our best efforts to rekindle relations between the two groups coming up naught, our best option seems to wane any flames which may threaten to erupt between them, unless we wish to suffer any internal scuffles."
  nf_MDR_17.a.tt: "Moles and Foresters makeup the inner members of the §CRepublic§!. It is best to keep both parties happy. If one sect has a sizable lean in the §CRepublic§!, they may cause a civil war if our £stability_icon §YStability§! drops too low."
  nf_MDR.17.a: "Settling friction between these parties will be no easy feat..."

  nf_MDR.18.t: "Hauled Supplies"
  nf_MDR.18.d: "Yuri, the old bastard himself has gotten incredibly luck. We first thought the poor old sap had lost his marbles after he didn't return for his shift. Some of the lads joked he tripped, and got lost in the thicket but thankfully the old man pulled through. He did, in fact. But as he got lost in the jungle he came across a warehouse, intact as a matter of fact. Getting out of the poor weather he managed to slip through one of the unlocked doorways. The warehouse must've been an army depot, or something. Much of the shelves still stacked with pre-war MREs and tinned stuff. Nothing fancy, but enough to last through the nuclear apocalypse. Most of the guards didn't believe Yuri at first, however the look on his face and his pockets inflated with tins said it all."
  nf_MDR.18.a: "We are eating good tonight, men!"

  nf_MDR.19.t: "Sickness Epidemic"
  nf_MDR.19.d: "Perhaps those MREs we came across weren't fit after all, or perhaps people should've not pigged out. Folks who have digested the food we found from the warehouse have seemingly started to come down with a fever. Nothing terrible, but its put a lot of useful folks out of work for some time. Yuri too, come to think of it. Hopefully most will return to their shift soon."
  nf_MDR.19.a: "They'll get over themselves, hopefully"
  nf_MDR.19.b: "Quick, cordon off the infected and closely monitor symptoms from afar!"

  nf_MDR.20.t: "Infection Outbreak"
  nf_MDR.20.d: "More of our populace are falling ill to the disease. What we thought was a simple case of the flu has erupted across our stations. Many have already succumbed to the disease, men women and children all beneath the barrel of the disease. We must find a cure or remedy the population soon."
  nf_MDR.20.a: "Hopefully this boils over shortly"
  nf_MDR.20.b: "Cordon off vitals, segregate infected and non-infected and prevent the disease from rapidly spreading!"

  nf_MDR.21.t: "Sick Populace"
  nf_MDR.21.d: "The situation worsens. Even the healthiest among our community are now falling sick beneath the disease. Citizens lock themselves in their accommodations and now refuse to go to work in fear of furthering the spread of the infection. Our doctors are well beyond breaking point by now, unless we find a miracle the infection will surely worsen overtime."
  nf_MDR.21.a: "This does not bold well"

  nf_MDR.22.t: "Disease Outbreak"
  nf_MDR.22.d: "The situation is becoming increasingly dire. Our doctors and medical staff are becoming encumbered from the amount of sick which are being treated. They are working well over capacity, with those who are far too sick or ill to be left to their gruesome fates."
  nf_MDR.22.a: "We must find a cure quick"

  nf_MDR.23.t: "Disease Epidemic"
  nf_MDR.23.d: "The situation worsens, more of our populace is becoming gravely ill from the disease. Our hospital and sick beds are well beyond capacity, as the dead and dying lay across the station floor. We have to find a cure, or treat these patients soon."
  nf_MDR.23.a: "We urgently need that cure!"

  nf_MDR.24.t: "Outbreak seems to be Waning"
  nf_MDR.24.d: "No new infections have been reported. Whether the virus has been fully staved off, or has burnt itself infecting as many as it could before natural immunity kicked in, we are unsure. However this traumatic event wont be forgotten in the Republics history anytime soon."
  nf_MDR.24.a: "Thank god its over"

  #nf_MDR.25.t: "Target Practise"
  #nf_MDR.25.d: "It gets pretty fucking tiring sitting around a squalid campfire waiting for action to unfold. So rather than boring yourself to sleep, why not go find the action instead? Its not like we're abandoning our posts anyways, "
  #nf_MDR.25.a: "Boys will be boys" 

  nf_MDR.26.t: "Contact with Kalininskaya"
  nf_MDR.26.d: "A rather peaceful collective of stations on the Kalininskaya which the confederation derives its name from. Fairly calm and tranquil, in recent years the collective has become an economic hub in the eastern section of the Metro. Apparently they have their own newspaper, although reports indicate they are the target of nasty rumours and gossip attempting to tarnish its reputation."
  nf_MDR.26.a: "I know what you are"
  nf_MDR.26.b: "Boys will be boys"

  nf_MDR.27.t: "Reconciliation with the Redline"
  nf_MDR.27.d: "Some things don't stay dead for long. Whether nostalgia, or an altruistic ideals Socialism has been reborn in Moscow. The Redline, humorously enough controls much of the Sokol line. In the past they had ideas of uniting the entire Metro beneath the banner of the revolution, but after fighting a grueling war with the Hanseatic League, both polities agreed to a ceasefire, drawing up their current borders."
  nf_MDR.27.a: "The pearly gates wont be open for your kind"
  nf_MDR.27.b: "We hope to reconcile and make amends"

  nf_MDR.28.t: "Contact with the Hanza"
  nf_MDR.28.d: "Dubbed the [HNZ.GetNameDef] from an organization of ages past, they are unanimously the most economically powerful state in the rest of the Metro. Owning the entire Koltsevskaya line, they can exercise supreme authority upon passing traders who step across their territory."
  nf_MDR.28.a: "Not too fond of capitalists"
  nf_MDR.28.b: "We shall prosper together!"

  nf_MDR.29.t: "The Lie comes Undone"
  nf_MDR.29.d: "Now that [MDR.GetLeader] authority reigns supreme, now should be an adequate time to announce the truth to the Republic. Moscow lives, in fact. For too long have the population of the Republic gone about their daily lives convinced with the fact they believe they are in fact the last Muscovites alive."
  nf_MDR.29.a: "Moscow is here. They are alive! Moscow §YLives!§!"
  nf_MDR.29.b: "NATO FORCES HAVE INFILTRATED MOSCOW!! WE MUST §YRECLAIM RUSSIA!§!"

  nf_MDR.30.t: "The Cherkizon"
  nf_MDR.30.d: "Our scouts report this Cherkizon place is in fact real, and not some myth spoused by surface traders to peddle their faulty tat. Apparently the place used to exist pre-war, and Muscovite authorities attempted and failed at removing the market. Only after the catastrophe has it rose from the ashes, and took on a new facade. A vast network of underground tunnels and catacombs which stretch fuck knows how far. Here you can pretty much purchase anything or anyone. Weapons, slaves hell even a hitman or two if the price is right."
  nf_MDR.30.a: "Your dirtied ways are an affront to the Republic!"
  nf_MDR.30.b: "Perhaps our two polities may peacefully co-exist?"

  nf_MDR.31.t: "Polis"
  nf_MDR.31.d: "The last bastion of humanity, or as the saying goes in the rest of the Metro. Apparently comprised of pre-war scientists, teachers and anyone worth shit. As the tales go, they're attempting to preserve the last notions of humanity in the darkness of the night. The effort is admirable, to say the least."
  nf_MDR.31.a: "Mere NATO propaganda..."
  nf_MDR.31.b: "Our two polities can peacefully co-exist"

  nf_MDR.32.t: "Kidnapping"
  nf_MDR.32.d: "During the night, a number of our citizenry were stolen."
  nf_MDR.32.a: "This does not bold well"#

  nf_MDR.33.t: "Collapsed Tunnel"
  nf_MDR.33.d: "[283.GetName] leads not to a dead end, as many would typically tell you. Through the piles of rubble and debris is in fact more track. Top brass thinks if we make efforts to sift through the trash, we could perhaps bore a hole large enough to fit people, and break through into the Metro proper."
  nf_MDR.33.a: "Excellent Idea"
