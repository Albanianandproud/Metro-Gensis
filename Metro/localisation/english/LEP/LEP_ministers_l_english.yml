  LEP_bulat_meladze: "Bulat Meladze"
  LEP_bulat_meladze_desc: "Appearing unbefittingly young for a station administrator, Meladze acts as the presiding chief of §YLesoparkovaya§! Meladze has proven to be just as competent as an administrator as any in spite of his ragged appearance and mild disposition. Preferring to prove himself directly through action. Meladze only speaks when there is something to be said, or acts when there is a need. Some may see him as lacking vision or always one step behind the curve, but regardless Bulat is fully intune with reality and more pragmatic than he lets on."
  LEP_bulat_meladze_trait: "Guarded"
  LEP_hagop: "Hagop"
  LEP_hagop_desc: "Enamored by the anti-mutant rhetoric of the Big Metro, Hagop has taken the herculean task upon himself to rid §YLesoparkovaya§! from the taint of mutant filth. Like the glory days of old, the station shall be reborn. A pure, proper decent station that even far flung stations may envy."
  LEP_hagop_trait: "Hates Mutants"
  LEP_daga: "Bastard Daga"
  LEP_daga_desc: "Once a lonely leader of a rag-tag group of thugs, now a station administrator. Things are starting to look up for old Daga, isn't it? Rather than growing old and content wasting away raiding the occasional caravan or vagabond, theres always riches and loot afar which can be plundered."
  LEP_daga_trait: "Diaspora Gang Leader"
