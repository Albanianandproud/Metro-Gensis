 SAV_makharadze_DESC: "Possibly one of the last surviving inhabitants from Timiryazevskaya back during when the station was populated by people, that day Makharadze narrowly avoided fate from swallowed by the oncoming tides of rats, managing to flee onto a motorized trolley as it departed. Ever since that day he has fiercely guarded his scant remaining blessings, still loyally guarding the tunnels leading into Timiryazevskaya like a dog following orders, But a tumor germinates within him that festers day by day in contemplation, even as the other few survivors moved on and attempted to start anew. Perhaps one more person could have been saved. Maybe if he was faster, or called out the rampaging sea of rats more would still be alive."

 SAV_ishchuk_DESC: "As the Soviet Union collapsed and Russia learned to cope with the culture shock of trendy market capitalism, Ishchuk found himself coming to terms easier than most. Through day-trading and seedy underhanded dealings with the burgeoning oligarkhi did his claim to fortune strike. Even after the apocalypse; like a cockroach Ishchuk found himself adapting his tactics and tone of words to suit a more humble, despondent class. With words no longer carrying their edge Ishchuk took on more forceful approach."
