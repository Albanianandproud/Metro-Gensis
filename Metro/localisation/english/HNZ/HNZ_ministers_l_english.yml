  HNZ_LOGINOV_DESC:0 "The Current residing President of the Commonwealth of the Ring Line. Under his watch, he guides the relatively young Inter-stational Commonwealth through the tricky politiking of the metro. But under his careful composure is a broken man haunted by the souls of those who he gave a false hope of asylum to during the bloody Hansa-Redline war. Whilst this decision to hand over so called 'anti-revolutionary' dissenters, to the Red line, to spare his own troops was the catalyst to propel his political career. This grim truth is little more than glossed over. With the blood of men, women and children still staining his hands to this day."

Returning to give war one final spur before he finally hits the hay."
