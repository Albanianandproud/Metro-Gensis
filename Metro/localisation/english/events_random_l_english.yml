 random_event.1.t:0 "Vagrants in the Tunnels"
 random_event.1.d:0 "Noises are heard coming from deep in the tunnels, right on the border of our territory. The sound of incomprehensible muttering and voices, which appear to sound human. A team sent to investigate discovers the sound coming from a band of vagrants skulking in a maintenance hall to the side of the tunnel. There they have established a rudimentary camp. With only the belongings on their back as respite. Some of the members wielded rather crude, however sophisticated hand-weapons made from scrap. They speak in an unfamiliar language yet strangely greeted your team with open arms. As communication between the vagrants was established by using gestures and sign language you discover they originated from the southern Metro. They had lived from place to place, never stopping. Headed by their patriarch, who had recently passed following an encounter with a frightful demon they now find themselves leaderless and wish to settle down."

 random_event.1.b_tt:0 "§gOur citizens come first unfortunately, the influx of an unknown alien group may make our own populace grow uneasy§!"

 random_event.2.t:0 "Glitters in the Dark"
 random_event.2.d:0 "One of the tunnel guardmens swears he sees something shine in the darkness. Every rotation when he returns back to station he spots a shimmer from beyond the tunnel in one of the old maintenance side paths. He is unable to investigate since said tunnel has been boarded up, with only a slight glimpse to see through. The Tunnel in question was boarded up years ago due to mutant incursions deep in that tunnel. The man stands by his guns, saying it isn't the trick of the light or his imagination. There is something down there, and wishes to investigate."

 random_event.3.t:0 "Mutant in the Tunnel"
 random_event.3.d:0 "The Wooden barricades were pryed open to reveal what was behind. Beyond the absolute void lay nothing. Then a hundred tiny beady white eyes pierced the darkness. There was a reason why that tunnel was closed. Today we recieved a grim reminder of why so."
 random_event.3.a:0 "Damn!"

 random_event.4.t:0 "Nothing of Value"
 random_event.4.d:0 "The Wooden barricades were pryed open to reveal what was behind. Beyond the absolute void lay nothing. Where the soldier said he could spot the speckles of light laid nothing. A blackened circular shape imprinted on the floor and on the ceiling. It smelled like a mixture of burnt rubber and sulphur. Whilst strange to say the least, nothing of value was found. The barricade reinburst and quickly that tunnel was forgotten again."
 random_event.4.a:0 "Damn!"

 random_event.5.t:0 "Something Lost, Something Found"
 random_event.5.d:0 "The Wooden barricades were pryed open to reveal what was behind. Beyond the absolute void lay nothing. A preliminary search held no account of the glimmers, and the search was about to be called off until the bouncing light off one of the flashlights revealed a sparkling in the darkness. A beam of light directed towards the glimmers revealed the soldier was speaking the truth infact. What lay beyond was..."

 random_event.6.t:0 "Station Babbler"
 random_event.6.d:0 "A strange man has started to rant in the middle of the station. Whilst he is off of his work duties he'll stand, perched ontop of an old soap box and rant about the most amusing of topics. From fringe beliefs about how 'Eurasia will Unite' and Humanity must dig down to reach the legendary below-kingdom of Agartha. To more humorous topics such as the notion that the Metro was infact built by Intelligent Gnomes in the 4th century who used the metro system to hide and store their absurd amounts of Kvass. Whilst the children sit and listen to his insane babbles, many of our citizens deject it. They find his rants somewhat amusing. A tinfoil-wearing, but rather harmless old man"
 random_event.6.a:0 "Kick him Out"
 random_event.6.b:0 "Let him stay"

 random_event.6.a_tt:0 "§gHarmless, it still doesn't give him an excuse to rant and rave about nonsensical topics. Spending his time scaring the children with false tales. Give him a boot up the ass and tell him to go his own way.§!"
 random_event.6.b_tt:0 "§gHe's a harmless old man, and brings an comical comfort to the daily lives of the stations citizens. Although he knows too much about the§! §OMetro Gnomes§! §gfor his own good...!§!"
