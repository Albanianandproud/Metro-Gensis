 kalininskaya_desc:0 "Controlling the Kalininskaya line. The Confederation occupies a fairly peaceful part of the metro, far detached from much of the strife of the Metro as a whole, with the only looming danger being the infrequent anomalies.\n\nPeaceful and hard-working, most of its population being simple workers. With every citizen in active employment."

 KAL_young_confederation:0 "Young Confederation"
 KAL_young_confederation_desc:0 "Confined to the far flung corner of the Metro upon the §YKalininskaya line§!, the Confederation occupies a fairly peaceful section of the Metro. Apart from the occasional band of Bandits, and the occasional Anomaly, much strife and conflict plagued by the rest of the Metro is far removed from their frontdoor."

 KAL_peaceful_economy:0 "Peaceful Economy"
 KAL_peaceful_economy_desc:0 "Because of the relative peace, the economy of §YKalininskaya§! is primarily focused on domestic production. Do not take the lack of arms workshops for laziness however, the populace of §YKalininskaya§! are hard-working with every citizen in active employment in some capacity."

 KAL_anomalies:0 "Anomalies"
 KAL_anomalies_desc:0 "The biggest problem facing Kalininskaya is the Anomalies which can be found upon the tunnels. The Spontaneous flame dubbed §Y'Dragons Breath'§! near §YPerovo§! and the even more mysterious §Y'Sirens Song'§! which ensnares up curious travelers to their untimely demise passing through the tunnels near §YAviamotornaya§!."

 KAL_the_mad_king:0 "A Madmans Rambles"
 KAL_the_mad_king_desc:0 "One rather dubious inhabitant of the Confederation is a hermitic man living at §YPerovo§! station. Dubbed crazy by other citizens of the station, his crazy ramblings suggests he believes himself to be the incorporeal descendant of the Romanovs; which one ruled Russia over a hundread years ago. Blending the tenets of Fourth Political Theory and Neo-Luddism into a new-age philosophy. The synthesis of §CLiberalism§!, §RMarxism§! and §gFascism§! with the rejection of 'wicked' technology to create an underground utopia.\n\nPeople laugh and dismiss his nonsense quite rightly, but give the poor old man sympathy and move on. However eventually people will listen to his ideals. As the blunders and shortcomings of the Confederation appear this will undoubtedly be the case."
