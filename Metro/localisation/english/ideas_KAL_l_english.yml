 kalininskaya_desc:0 "Controlling the Kalininskaya line. The Confederation occupies a fairly peaceful part of the metro, far detached from much of the strife of the Metro as a whole, with the only looming danger being the infrequent anomalies.\n\nPeaceful and hard-working, most of its population being simple workers. With every citizen in active employment."

 KAL_the_mad_king:0 "A Madmans Rambles"
 KAL_the_mad_king_desc:0 "One rather dubious inhabitant of the Confederation is a homeless man living at Perovo station. His crazy, ramblings suggest he is the incorporeal descendant of the Romanovs; which once ruled Russia over a hundred years ago. His ideology blends that of the Fourth Political Theory and Neo-Luddism into a new-age philosophy. The synthesis of Liberalism, Marxism and Fascism and the rejection of 'wicked' technology to create a utopia. People tend to give a poor distraught old man sympathy and move on, but inevitably people will listen to his ideals. As the Blunders and shortcomings of the Confederation appear this is undoubtedly the case."
