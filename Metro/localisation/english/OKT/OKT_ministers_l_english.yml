  OKT_leander_nekrasov: "Leander Nekrasov"
  OKT_NEKRASOV_DESC: "When you hold the most steady trigger-finger and can land the most accurate shot amongst the security team, most will show respect. Having been the de-jure administrator of Oktyabrskaya ever since orchestrating the rapid defense of the station against Tretyakov raids, a odd sense of normalcy persists at Oktyabrskaya. Might be far from the simple, idyllic living of ring-line stations, but thanks to Nekrasovs strong committment to maintaining order, and constant vigilance most at Oktyabrskaya live reasonably well.\n\nThough with the Bandits from the Triangle growing more emboldened week by week, and more men than mutants being sighted, Nekrasov has his work cut out."
  OKT_oleg_sorokin: "Oleg Sorokin"
  OKT_SOROKIN_DESC: "Being a former (though unaccomplished) sports shooter tends to find its perks come in hand. Perhaps being able to wield a gun, and keep your composure possesses more than a few administrative qualities, however when problems are innevitably brought to him Sorokin has found himself to have a knack for de-escalation tension and resolving problems before they can blow right up in his face. With a dozen or so kills to his name, nobody has yet dared to go against his word, or put his aim to the test."
  OKT_guarded: "Guarded"
  OKT_free_stalker: "Independent Stalker"
