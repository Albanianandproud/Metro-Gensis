 nf_HNZ.1.t:0 "Introduction"
 nf_HNZ.1.d:0 "I reminisce fondly upon those days. Even as ash and radiation had yet to completely settle, there was a semblance of calmness, despite to today. People suffered greatly ofcourse, but not as much as people do today. People regarded their fellow man, there was order. Peace.\n\nWhat I remember most about those early years however, during the days of the Central Metro Command was..."
 nf_HNZ.1.a:0 "My position as a Committee member of Polis"
 nf_HNZ.1.b:0 "Being A Former Resident of Komsomolskaya Radialnaya"

 nf_HNZ.2.t:0 "Elected President"
 nf_HNZ.2.d:0 "From my participating Role during the Coalition Wars; being an active representative on the Coalition side during the Peace Talks with the Red Line. My poltical career was propelled forward, Only Being Recently Elected by the board of Directors. Upon my background as being a veteran, my other reason was my election promises which were..."

 HNZ_agenda_introduction: "This Event unlocks an §YAgenda§!. §YAgendas§! are §YTimed-Decisions§! with certain requirements to pass. Once their requirements are met provide substantial bonuses. Completing these §YDecisions§! will reinforce our Political Control across the §YCommonwealth§!."

 nf_HNZ.3.t:0 "Those Demons"
 nf_HNZ.3.d:0 "But that war... that damn war. Blood stained the tunnels and bodies clogged the gutters over what? Ideas of equality and justice? Democracy? When you gaze upon the mounds of corpses killed by your own volition you begin to despair. The lives of several dozen if not hundreds of women, children? Yields of an ultimatum. No more than a statistic shortly forgotten. My own actions lead to the countless death of innocent civilians. When we returned to Coalition territory we were paraded as heroes. But I saw no champions that day."
 nf_HNZ.3.a:0 "I am Haunted by the War"

 nf_HNZ.4.t:0 "Three year old Commonwealth"
 nf_HNZ.4.d:0 "A near year is upon us, General. The State of the Metro is stable, for now. But we cannot be sure this balance will always be kept afloat. As we occupy the Ring, and have the final say of whoever... or whatever comes in or out of the Ring Line, many foes abroad may envy our position. The Redline still holds a bitter resentment against us for slashing their dreams of Unification of the Red line; They may seek to exert their influnce onto their neighbouring stations of [281.GetName] and [349.GetName] which we fear the latter is already poised to fall within the hands of the rising Bolshevist menace. However for now the Redline is gridlocked into an eternal war with the Fourth Reich; a Neo-Nazi paramilitary force which has recently claimed the stations of [306.GetName], [275.GetName] and [337.GetName] as their own. The Nazis currently are more than content to sit inside their station fortresses, but will eventually seek to expand their rotting influence against their neighbouring stations. We may come to the aid of the denizens of [418.GetName] and [312.GetName] when that may happen, or let it slip by. The Reich may provide an adequate trading partner if they would only cease their hostilities... Perhaps for a greater cause stemming the tide of communism?\n\nLet us remind ourselves this. We are the Commonwealth of the Ring Line. The Most wealthiest, affluent community in the entire nation. Our word and economic might is second to none."
 nf_HNZ.4.a:0 "To a New Future for the Commonwealth!"

 nf_HNZ.5.t:0 "Pressuring by the Hanza"
 nf_HNZ.5.d:0 "The Hansa has pressured us into opening our sphere of trade to them. They will no longer allow our wares to be sold inside their stations and furthermore won't allow us passage through their territory unless we comply with their demands. Complying with the Hansa may have hug implications to the legitimacy of our rule."
 nf_HNZ.5.a:0 "We don't barter with Subhumans."
 nf_HNZ.5.b:0 "We must comply"

 nf_HNZ.6.t:0 "Pressuring the Reich Failed"
 nf_HNZ.6.d:0 "The Reich unsuprisingly has refused to kneel to our demands to open their economic sphere. Outraged by such a suggestion. Once more they remain hermitic to their 3 stations as our chance to coax them into closer relations to us has failed."
 nf_HNZ.6.a:0 "Ok"

 nf_HNZ.7.5.t:0 "Pressure Reich Succeeded!"
 nf_HNZ.7.d:0 "The Reich, somewhat suprisingly has accepted the offering. As diplomats from both sides agreed to meet outside of the Reich Territory in a wayside tunnel as to not catch the attention of any ideologically fanatic members of the Reich. Caravans will be sent from Hansa and return carrying Reich goods from Tverskaya. Whilst hostilities remain still from the Fascists; they have set aside their mantra for now atleast."
 nf_HNZ.7.a:0 "Ok"

 nf_HNZ.8.t:0 "Trade Sent to the Reich"
 nf_HNZ.8.d:0 "The Trade caravans arrive from Tverskaya, stockaded with Reich goods. Suprisingly for a isolationist community their internal economy is rather strong. With industries dedicated to domestic goods such as clothing and utensils. Suprising from a community so hell-bent on lebensraum."
 nf_HNZ.8.a:0 "A promising trade opportunity"
 nf_HNZ.8.b:0 "We don't deal with Subhumans"

 nf_HNZ.9.t:0 "Trade with Reich Succeeded!"
 nf_HNZ.9.d:0 "The Reich has accepted the terms of the deal. They have sat on a stockpile of rather cutting-edge electronics and high-quality alloys scavenged from the surrounding surface area. Whilst they're reluctant to sell those goods to so called 'mutants', they have instead allowed us to purchase and barter their second rate resources, which still is jusst as good. The Average person isn't going to distinct an aluminium rod from a durable carbon composite.
 nf_HNZ.9.a:0 "Awesome"

 nf_HNZ.10.t:0 "Trading Armaments with the Reich"
 nf_HNZ.10.d:0 "The Hansa has sent us another offering. They wish for us to purchase a number of their high-grade weaponry. Trade caravans will arrive shortly after the trade is signed. The Caravan will stop a few hundred feet away from the boundaries of the Reich during rotation as to not disturb soldiers placed on guard. The caravans would then only need to be stocked with Hansas demands and they would be sent back to Hansa territory."
 nf_HNZ.10.a:0 "It seems like a win-win to us"
 nf_HNZ.10.b:0 "How many times are you going to ask, Mutant?"

 nf_HNZ.11.t:0 "Trading guns Succeeded"
 nf_HNZ.11.d:0 "The Caravans returned, stocked full of Reich Goods from their half of the deal. A little underwhelming for what we sold them. However this is the Reich we're talking about. I'm sure eventually even fascists will warm up to the smell of a good trade partner."
 nf_HNZ.11.a:0 "They'll be promising trade partners in no time!"

 nf_HNZ.12.t:0 "Polis Agreement"
 nf_HNZ.12.d:0 "Another Hansa Diplomat Returns to us pledging an offer. Polis lies just right outside of our territory, and the Reich dreams of annexing the foul mutant station, adding the final arm to the Glorious Axis. However Hansa provides a different deal. In Return for our pledge to stay away from Polis and turn our attention elsewhere. They wil... look the other way if we were to invade Savelovskaya. They even would show us plans of secret utility passageways and tunnels which lead to that station in return for us to keep up our bargain."
 nf_HNZ.12.a:0 "We can turn our attention elsewhere.. for now"
 nf_HNZ.12.b:0 "Polis belongs to the Reich"

 HNZ_nf_HNZ.12_tt:0 "§gIn Return for bypassing the focus, we will unlock a decision to invade Savelovskaya when we go to war with Dimitrovskaya§!"

 nf_HNZ.13.t:0 "Reich Accepts the Deal"
 nf_HNZ.13.d:0 "Reich, whilst dreams of invading Polis has chosen to accept our deal, and will instead turn their raging fever dream of Lebensraum elsewhere. I hope we haven't doomed the entire metro..."
 nf_HNZ.13.a:0 "Great!"

 nf_HNZ.14.t:0 "Reich Denies"
 nf_HNZ.14.d:0 "The Reich have chosen to turn down our offer. Chosing to remain aloof to our trade offer, whilst hostilities with the diplomats did not break out into anything major. It could be easily seen that the Reich Officials were however disaffected with our negotiations."
 nf_HNZ.14.a:0 "Damn!"

 nf_HNZ.15.t:0 "Trade with the Mobsters"
 nf_HNZ.15.d:0  "The Hansa has sent us a trade offering. Hoping that we would open our trade markets for Hansa to purchase goods from. The whole sloppy lingo that capitalist bureaucrats love to use. Whilst a dubiously written letter, it does provide an interesting trade partner."
 nf_HNZ.15.a:0 "Trade With Hanza? Ofcourse! how could we not?"
 nf_HNZ.15.b:0 "No Thanks"

 nf_HNZ.16.t:0 "Trade with the Mobsters Succeeded"
 nf_HNZ.16.d:0 "Whilest often than not the Mobsters usually tend to their own, and go out into the big metro to ambush and capture caravans they were suprisingly open to our trade deal"
 nf_HNZ.16.a:0 "Great!"

 nf_HNZ.17.t:0 "Hanza Offers Tools"
 nf_HNZ.17.d:0 "The Hanza comes with another trade deal. They will sell us any industrial tools they have recouperated in their rather ample stockpile. Power tools, hand tools, even a machine presser they stole from a gun factory on the surface. In return, they wish to hire some of our finest thug-- i mean.. troops off our hands."
 nf_HNZ.17.a:0 "Sure! We didn't need Pavel or Arkady anyways."
 nf_HNZ.17.b:0 "You again? Go away!"

 nf_HNZ.18.t:0 "Trade with the Mobsters Succeeded"
 nf_HNZ.18.d:0 "The trade with the mobsters succeeded, in return they sent a detachment of their troops to assist us for the time being. They're rather scruffy looking, but what they lack in composure they make up in efficiency."
 nf_HNZ.18.a:0 "Great!"

 nf_HNZ.19.t:0 "Trading Resources"
 nf_HNZ.19.d:0 "The hansa come proposing another offer. Over the years the Hansa has confiscated numerous wares from merchants and tradesmen alike and have built up a rather large sizable stockpile of illict goods. They're offering expunge said stockpiles into our hands in return for any resources we can trade them. Seems like a win-win, huh?"
 nf_HNZ.19.a:0 "Ofcourse!"
 nf_HNZ.19.b:0 "Your empty offers are starting to piss is off..."

 nf_HNZ.20.t:0 "Trade with the Mobsters Succeeded"
 nf_HNZ.20.d:0 "Trade caravans from the Mobsters already arrive at our door. Surprisingly, mobsters and thugs can be traded with."
 nf_HNZ.20.a:0 "Awesome"

 nf_HNZ.21.t:0 "Mobsters Denied"
 nf_HNZ.21.d:0 "The Mobsters have denied our request, rather staying aloof to our trade proposition."
 nf_HNZ.21.a:0 "Damn"

 nf_HNZ.22.t:0 "Satellite Requesting Factory Aid"
 nf_HNZ.22.d:0 "One of our satellites as requested a lend lease of factory assistance from the Hansa. Whether military build-up or mutant incursions, they seek our immediate help with their military production."
 nf_HNZ.22.a:0 "Aid Request"
 nf_HNZ.22.b:0 "We'd Rather not"

 nf_HNZ.23.t:0 "Arms Request Failed"
 nf_HNZ.23.d:0 "Hansa has refused to lend assistance to help our cause. Whether because they felt like we didn't need the help or outright refused. It seems we are on our own for now"
 nf_HNZ.23.a:0 "Screw them then!"

 nf_HNZ.24.t:0 "Arms Request Succeeded"
 nf_HNZ.24.d:0 "Hansa has agreed to help our armories out and have provided tools and assistance. Whilst this will have certain unforseen consequences on our economy, it will surely help roster our military with better equipment."
 nf_HNZ.24.a:0 "Great News!"

 nf_HNZ.25.t:0 "Canceled Arms Request"
 nf_HNZ.25.d:0 "Our Satellite has returned our arsenals back into our hand. No longer needing our assistance. "
 nf_HNZ.25.a:0 "Ok"

 nf_HNZ.26.t:0 "Joint-Special Operations"
 nf_HNZ.26.d:0 "The hanseatic league has arrived to us with a proposition. With the mobilisation of the Red Line and growing power of the reich the stability of the Metro is at peril. Prying eyes wish to impose their will on the free peoples of the metro. Not to mention the growing threat of mutants. They wish to pool our military together and being combined arm drills and special operations to better support and connect our forces against any oncoming threat."
 nf_HNZ.26.a:0 "Our Forces can learn alot from one another"
 nf_HNZ.26.b:0 "The Hanseatic League cannot be Trusted"

 nf_HNZ.27.t:0 "Hanza Musters"
 nf_HNZ.27.d:0 "The Hanseatic League would rather much pressure foes with economic sanctions and embargoes. However expansion is a different scenario all together. They seek to undermine the legitimacy of their neighbouring stations through economic and political subversion. Home markets filled with foreign Hanseatic wares. Ensuring that their neighbours are dependent on their goods to survive. Slowly chipping away at their independence until they're no longer able to be self sufficient and then eventually become a mere puppet of Hansas bidding."
 nf_HNZ.27.a:0 "Oh Dear"

 nf_HNZ.28.t:0 "Hansa Wishes to purchase our Station"
 nf_HNZ.28.d:0 "The Hanseatic league approaches us with an interesting proposition. The wish to purchase our trade station of Belorusskaya. They seemed much adament on this deal even so to the point they're willing to pull in a larger amount of resources on their end of the bargain for the station. Its not like a Hanseatic trader to be lenient on haggling. However it appears they very much would like to purchase this station from our hands."
 nf_HNZ.28.a:0 "You drive a hard bargain... but we accept"
 nf_HNZ.28.b:0 "That station belongs to us"

 nf_HNZ.29.t:0 "Men from the Eagle"
 nf_HNZ.29.d:0 "Men from the south approached us with a proposition. Somehow they have heard of our ample stockpile of Fuel. Whether it be from an escaped slave, or one of the thugs passing gossip. Either way they ask to purchase the fuel source from our hands in return for slaves. Criminals, Vagrants or just too sick to be any usage to their administration. They will send us bodies in return for the fuel they so desperately need."
 nf_HNZ.29.a:0 "Sure, more manpower for the pit!"
 nf_HNZ.29.b:0 "Go Away!"

 nf_HNZ.30.t:0 "Satanist Deal Completed"
 nf_HNZ.30.d:0 "The Satanists have accepted our deal, in return for the exchange of a decent number of outcasts from our society they will hand us several barrels of their fuel."
 nf_HNZ.30.a:0 "Awesome"

 nf_HNZ.31.t:0 "Satanist Deal Failed"
 nf_HNZ.31.d:0 "The Satanists have refused to our deal. Ordering our diplomat convoy to leave the boundaries of their station or else they'll incur the rath of Satan himself."
 nf_HNZ.31.a:0 "Damn"

 nf_HNZ.32.t:0 "Industrial Equipment Discovered"
 nf_HNZ.32.d:0 "Our Scavengers have returned from venturing forth onto the surface. Carrying with them they had various amounts of industrial equipment and mechanical parts they had picked from a desolate complex on the top. Most stuff has been stripped clean, and almost were going to call it until they stumbled upon a rather desolate and run-down warehouse. Even more so than the surrounding blasted buildings."
 nf_HNZ.32.a:0 "Valentin, open the blast door! help them carry the stuff in!"

 nf_HNZ.33.t:0 "Tooling Blueprints Discovered"
 nf_HNZ.33.d:0 "Our scavengers have recently returned. Whilst on first sight their hands appeared to be empty of any items or articles picked clean from the surface. One of the members had a backpack filled to the brim with various manuscripts in varying quality; books and manuals. They had come across what appeared to be an old-soviet library or book store. Whatever the case was they had found varying books detailing industrial processes and manuals. Unfortunately the state of the books are alot to be desired, and appearing for some of them to be rather rudimentary in skill rather simplistic. They'll nontheless provide valuable information for our budding engineers and technicians."
 nf_HNZ.33.a:0 "This one even has pictures!"

 nf_HNZ.34.t:0 "Tools Discovered"
 nf_HNZ.34.d:0 "Our Scavengers returned, with them carrying various boxes and toolcases. Screws, hammers, drills and other sorts of tooling of varying sizes and calibre. It appears they had struck it big during the when the scavenging team were caught slap bang in the middle of a blizzard. Seeking the nearest cover they must have stumbled upon an old garage or auto-dealer of sorts. Bringing as much as they could carry with them back once the storm had passed."
 nf_HNZ.34.a:0 "Great"

 nf_HNZ.35.t:0 "Industrial Machinery Discovered"
 nf_HNZ.35.d:0 "Our Scavengers returned. Carrying with them what appears to be some pressing machine of sorts. They had discovered it in an old Museum of sorts. Whilst manufacturing details such as date and place of it being built has long since worn off. It looks old; pre-Khrushchev or even Pre-Stalin. The scavengers could not make heads or tails its date. Whatever it still works remarkably well despite clear signs of age and tarnish from the chilled elements."
 nf_HNZ.35.a:0 "Put it right over there! The corner near the pig farms!"


 nf_HNZ.36.t:0 "Scouring the North"
 nf_HNZ.36.d:0 "Whilst scavenging the wreckages of the Northern Districts of Moscow. Our Stalkers came across what appared to be a rather sizable stockpile of Metal Detectors. We may be able to put them to good use scavenging for more resources. Or could instead break them down for parts"
 nf_HNZ.36.a:0 "We can put them to good use"
 nf_HNZ.36.b:0 "We can scrap them, and salvage the materials"


 nf_HNZ.37.t:0 "Scouring the South"
 nf_HNZ.37.d:0 "Our stalkers have encountered what appears to be a derelict convoy of stalkers on the surface. Numerous frozen, half-chewed bodies stretched around in a circle of a retrofitted camper van. None of the bodies could be identified as their remains were too unrecognisable to decipher, but it appeared that the battle had occoured several weeks ago. Either they got caught out in the cold and froze to death, or were caught in a Watcher stampede. Whatever the case it apeared the site had already been picked by scavengers. Although we had discovered various schematics of some degree in one of the storage compartments inside the van they were so desperately defending. With some elbow grease and a loud clang they had gotten the compartment to open. We may use these blueprints to improve the firepower of our firearms, or instead use them to better design them with more usable and easier to find resources."
 nf_HNZ.37.a:0 "Cheaper Guns"
 nf_HNZ.37.b:0 "Better Guns"

 nf_HNZ.38.t:0 "A remarkable Discovery"
 nf_HNZ.38.d:0 "Whilst encountering a derelict depot on the surface, which lead down into the Metro our stalkers came across what almost could be described as a tank on rail-wheels. The tank looks reasonably modern, 70s or 80s. It had been retrofitted to use rail lines instead of conventional roads. Heavy manufacturing and precision went into the manufacturing of this from what it appears. Possibly predating the rise of many factions of the Metro itself considering the delicate tooling needed to pull this off. Possibly the work of the Central Metro Command? Whilst the Central Metro Command fell apart before it could be deployed. We can still use this tank, considering it is already on rails. The only issue is getting it back into the Metro."
 nf_HNZ.38.a:0 "We can retrofit the tank to serve us"
 nf_HNZ.38.b:0 "Scrap it for Parts"

 nf_HNZ.38_tt:0 "§gOne Rail Panzer brigade spawns at our capital§!"

 nf_HNZ.39.t:0 "Hanseatic Meddling"
 nf_HNZ.39.d:0 "The Hanseatic league has stated they will no longer secure our station from outside incursion, and will draft up plans to mobilise our economy and forces. This will surely have ramifications upon out legitimacy and authority in the station."
 nf_HNZ.39.a:0 "We must comply"
 nf_HNZ.39.b:0 "Go off Yourself!"

 nf_HNZ.40.t:0 "Stalkers Return"
 nf_HNZ.40.d:0 "The Scavengers have returned, with them they have come across good fortunes. Returning with equipment."
 nf_HNZ.40.a:0 "Good Job"

 nf_HNZ.41.t: "Agenda Concluded"
 nf_HNZ.41.d: "The Agenda has been concluded, and we were successful in achieving the targeted aims. Our Influence grows amongst the Merchant and local station administrations. The Board of Directors will undoubtedly continue to support Loginov for years to come."
 nf_HNZ.41.a: "Our Influence Grows" 

 nf_HNZ.42.t: "Agenda Failure"
 nf_HNZ.42.d: "The Commitment to completing the agenda was failed to be resolved, and as a result the Board of Directors question their support for Logniovs Government"
 nf_HNZ.42.a: "That is not good"

 nf_HNZ.43.t: "Agenda : Year 2"
 nf_HNZ.43.d: "A new Year is upon us, and another aim we should target. The Board of Directors have discussed amongst themselves, and they believe the Hanseatic League should prioritise..."

 nf_HNZ.46.a: "Reeling in Neighbors to our Influence"
 nf_HNZ.46.b: "Expanding Hansa outside the Ring"
 nf_HNZ.46.c: "Safeguarding against Bolshevism"

 nf_HNZ.47.t: "Agenda : Year 6"
 nf_HNZ.47.d: "A new Year is upon us. 6 Years has passed since Logniov was first elected as acting President of the Commonwealth. The Hansa has saw itself prosper under his tenure, but as the Metro quickly destabilises into strife, the Board of Directors discuss amongst themselves whether Logniov can properly deal with these new issues."
 nf_HNZ.47.a: "Lets hope the Directors come to a conclusion quickly."

 nf_HNZ.48.t: "Agenda : Outcome"
 nf_HNZ.48.d: "The Discussions between the Board of Directors have concluded. Despite their growing concerns for the Metro, and the Hansas place in the engulfing strife the Hansa shall move forward. They Conclude that..."
 nf_HNZ.48.a: "Hansa Must Guide the Metro against these threats"
 nf_HNZ.48.b: "Peace between all parties must be achieved."
 nf_HNZ.48.c: "Loginov shall continue to Serve"

 nf_HNZ.49.t: "Hanseatic League Seeks a Trade Agreement"
 nf_HNZ.49.d: "The Hanseatic Commonwealth has come to us with a trade proposal. In return for the vital resources we lack within our production lines, they seek our assistance in repairing and salvaging Rail Vehicles. This would undoubtedly strengthen our relation with the Commonwealth, but many fear this would allow the Hansa a 'foot in the door' to subvert our Alliance."
 nf_HNZ.49.a: "We need those resources, we accept."
 nf_HNZ.49.b: "The Alliance sees your plot, Hansa."

 nf_HNZ.50.t: "Bauman Alliance Accepts Trade"
 nf_HNZ.50.d: "Negotiations between the Bauman Alliance and the Hansa has reached its end. The Alliance has agreed to our terms of the deal, and in return will help fix and maintain our Rail Vehicles."
 nf_HNZ.50.a: "Great News"

 nf_HNZ.51.t: "Bauman Alliance Declines Trade"
 nf_HNZ.51.d: "Negotiations between the Baumansky Alliance and the Hanseatic League has reached an abrupt decline, resulting in the Alliances' decision to decline our offer."
 nf_HNZ.51.a: "They'll regret that decision"

 nf_HNZ.52.t: "Ring of Steel"
 nf_HNZ.52.d: "The Ring line is the lifeblood of the Commonwealth. No foreign threat can penetrate through, nor can any station break out. However, many stations are bound by us economically, having to move through our stations to trade with one another. With the sheer amount of people passing through our stations, it is a surmountable task by our guards to check and prune each passenger for spies or would-be saboteurs. One idea suggested is that of a installing a passport system. Ensuring each station complies with this concept will be a little difficult however."
 nf_HNZ.52.a: "They shall comply to our Authority"
 NF_HNZ.52.a.tooltip: "We will gain §Y20 Political Power§! for every §YNeighboring Station§! who complies."

 nf_HNZ.53.t: "Question of Passport Requirements?"
 nf_HNZ.53.d: "As the Hansa begins to install a passport system for navigating through and between their stations, they have issued a statement. All neighboring stations must also comply with this system, to be able to trade and move through the Hanseatic League. Whilst seemingly to deter criminals, and as a means to easily verify travelers, this will undoubtedly be used by Hanseatic Administration to further bind neighboring stations to their influence."
 nf_HNZ.53.a: "This would be a good idea"
 nf_HNZ.53.b: "No, Hansa wont push and bully us around"

 nf_HNZ.54.t: "Hanza orders compliance"
 nf_HNZ.54.d: "The Hanseatic League has issued us a statement; issue identifiable passports for our citizenry to be able to travel and trade between and over Hansa Settlements or risk being outright barred from Hanseatic Stations. How should we respond?"
 nf_HNZ.54.a: "We should comply with the Commonwealth"
 nf_HNZ.54.b: "No, we wont be bullied by Hansa"

 nf_HNZ.55.t: "[PREV.GetNameDef] Agrees to Passport Requirements"
 nf_HNZ.55.d: "Whether by persuasive political negotiation, or the fear of harsh economic reprisals, [PREV.GetNameDef] has agreed to our idea of a Passport Identification system."
 nf_HNZ.55.a: "That is good to hear"

 nf_HNZ.56.t: "[PREV.GetNameDef] Rejects Passport Idea"
 nf_HNZ.56.d: "Whether not swooned by our persuasive political negotiations, or too ignorant forsee any economic reprisals, [PREV.GetNameDef] has politely rejected our idea of a Unified Passport Identification system. Only time will tell whether they stick to their guns, or ultimately conceed."
 nf_HNZ.56.a: "They wont hold out for much longer."

 nf_HNZ.57.t: "Special Relations"
 nf_HNZ.57.d: "Despite our power and influence now a fading memory. The Hanseatic League and Arbat has always had a special relation. Forged in the fires of the Coalition Wars, the Hansa has always has been a close friend with the Arbat Confederation\n\nWith the Strengthening of both of our economies, they are being closely intergrated with one another."
 nf_HNZ.57.a: "Our Citizens have alot in common"
 nf_HNZ.57.b: "The Coalition sprouted a deep Friendship"
 nf_HNZ.57.c: "Our Military Forces are still unmatched"

 nf_HNZ.58.t: "Military Relations"
 nf_HNZ.58.d: "Whilst the Hanseatic League fields untold hundreads of standing troops, the central government are ambivalent to our cause. However, while not directly histile, our shared interest of stemming threats in the Metro has had the inadverted addition of sprouting a decent standing between our forces. Whilst the Central Government in Prospekt Mira doubts our capacity, the Military of the Hansa holds respect for our Force.\n\nMost often than not going out of their way to help assist our force and our troops."
 nf_HNZ.58.a: "Our Gunsmiths may share schematics and techniques"
 nf_HNZ.58.b: "Our Craftsmen have alot to share with one another"
 nf_HNZ.58.c: "In return for Resources, we shall provide tactics"

 nf_HNZ.59.t: "Reich"
 nf_HNZ.59.d: "As the Fuhrer stirs his subjects into fanatical frenzy, the Iron legions of the Reich are eternally gridlocked in a war against the hordes of Redline soldiers. Constantly pounding and eeking away at their very front door. Whilst the Reich itself does not permit anyone non Human or non-aryan to enter, signalled by the grim effigies to deter any would-be intruders at their front door, our contact with some personel within the Reich is not entiery diminished, and could be a good launching pad to hold talks and even trade with the Fascists."
 nf_HNZ.59.a: "Whilst some trade occured, there was very little of note."
 nf_HNZ.59.b: "The two traded within civilian goods, though nothing of noticable discern"

 nf_HNZ.60.t: "Redline"
 nf_HNZ.60.d: "The Glory days of the soviet union has long since faded, and the old heads amongst the upper Politburo still reminisce and live in days past, the Redline continues to remain a military power within the Metro. Their citizenry eternally starved, and able to amass untold dozens of footsoldiers and conscripts for their bloody war against the Reich. Despite the conclusion of the Coalition wars, many amongst the upper crust still hold disdain against the Commonwealth. Despite the differences in ideology, like dogs with their tails between their legs the Redline comes to us to trade and support."

 nf_HNZ.62.t: "The Hanza musters for war!"
 nf_HNZ.62.d: "In daring attack, the forces of the Hanza have struck against our border guards and are now moving in to our turf. It seems like these bastards didn't quite get the memo. Seems like we've got a war on our hands now."
 nf_HNZ.62.a: "Get the boys up and armed. We're off to war"

 nf_HNZ.64.t: "Invisible Observers Take Control"
 nf_HNZ.64.d: "Foriegn Spies have infiltrated the Hanseatic League, and are plotting to destroy Mother Russia from the inside! This cannot be allowed! Loginov has been terminated of his duties and the Moscow Defense Council now commands the Board of Directors. The Fate of the Metro is now in our hands. The Russian Government is back."
 nf_HNZ.64.a: "Taking Direct Control. Russia shall be Reclaimed"

 nf_HNZ.65.t: "Fuel for Slaves?"
 nf_HNZ.65.d: "According to rumours, the Satanists are a ferocious foe skulking in the deepest darkest recesses of the Metro. Reknowned for their sadist nature and gruesome methods of torture, their maddening cries and whines strike fear into the hears of even the most cold of soldiers. However, it is believed they are in supply of the last few droplets of Gasoline that hasn't been turned into varnish. How? We do not know, but the Hansa has a great deal of convicts currently incarcerated. Perhaps we could sell them our dregs, in return to grab some of their fuel?"

 nf_HNZ.66.t: "Flamethrowers for Troops?"
 nf_HNZ.66.d: "Whilst the usage of Flamethrowers have become a more widespread practise in recent memory, It was Dimitrovskayas own technicians which first unleashed this weapon during the infestation of Timiryazevskaya in 2014. Its known, they have constant beef with the denizens of the Reich, and reports tell of human-sized rat people skulking the northern tunnels. Almost every abled-body person of the Alliance is pulled into service. From the sick and wounded, even schoolboys and the old must heed. Perhaps we can offer them some of the Hansas finest troops, in return for those flamethrowers they had used all those years ago?"

 nf_HNZ.67.d: "The Hanseatic League have arrived, in return for supplying them with our fuel supplies, we will provide us with ample slaves needed to dig deeper into the Earth. They look scraggly however, it seems like the Hansa weren't providing their most ample and durable convicts."

 nf_HNZ.68.t: "Hansa provides Manpower in return for Flamers"
 nf_HNZ.68.d: "The Hanseatic League have arrived, in return for supply them with spare flamethrowers and blueprints, they shall provide us with manpower and soldiers."
 nf_HNZ.68.a: "Those troops are needed for the Alliance to survive."

 nf_HNZ.72.t: "Ratmen Expedition : Scaven Commonwealth"
 nf_HNZ.72.d: "Reports rumour that Ratpeople skulk the north recesses of the Metro. Although those reports come with hushed voices, and timid expressions they undoubtedly strike fear into the bar-flies, or just make for good gossip all around.\n\nTo dispell these rumours once and for all, plans have been drawn up to explore the further metro tunnel lines. Whether or not ratmen exist is still debated, but this expedition will put a firm stop.\n\nThose rumours turned out to be true. Mutant Rat people indeed exist in the northern line. It appears they have formed a society with schoolhouses and public facilities properly maintained. Aloof to humans incurring on their border, and only pretending to be savage mutants to deter anyone daring to entrench on their territory."
 nf_HNZ.72.a: "All we see are business opportunities"
 nf_HNZ.72.b: "Your kind is an affront to our Race, Rat"

Whether or not ratmen exist is still debated, but this expedition will put a firm stop."

 nf_HNZ.70.t: "Ratmen Expedition"
 nf_HNZ.70.d: "The Expedition made its way north from Mendeleevskaya, the tunnels despite a dangerous threat proved to be tricky to navigate. Thankfully posing no real threat to the success of the mission. However, what else skulked within the darkness managed to inflict a tremendous amount of damage to our forces. Assailed by mutants, the party only just managed to escape from being ensared into a grizzly fate. Taking refuge at Dimitrovskaya station, they packed up and moved out the following hours afterwards."

 HNZ_random_event.1.t:0 "Underhanded Trader"
 HNZ_random_event.1.d:0 "A rather shrewd merchant in one of our stations has been caught selling ilicit goods.

 HNZ_random_event.1.a_tt:0 "§gWe wont let their wares to be sold in our territory, but we can sell them to neighbouring stations, and get a profit in return§!"

 HNZ_random_event.2.t:0 "Traders barred from Entry"
 HNZ_random_event.2.d:0 "Along one of our radial ring stations a caravan was barred from entry into the Hansa for not having passports at the ready. They come from the far flung region of the Metro and state they had never recalled there ever being a 'passport' inspection or mandatory passports ever being a thing. Their intentions seems good; they only seek to sell their wares to make enough bullets to feed their station, currently starving from mushroom shortages."
 HNZ_random_event.2.a:0 "No Passport? No Entry"
 HNZ_random_event.2.b:0 "Make an exception - have a guard watch them closely whilst they trade"

 HNZ_random_event.3.t:0 "Bandit Raid!"
 HNZ_random_event.3.d:0 "A recent bandit incursion has held a tunnel hostage against incoming trade or traffic. Randsoming caravans by if not outright shooting them merely stepping into their domain.

 HNZ_random_event.5.d:0 "A man rushes into the station, sweat and tears running down his face. He claims that the pipes had swallowed his caravan whole. He was the only survivor of the encounter. Scared shitless he is horrified of venturing back out there to salvage the wares, with only the clothes on his back to carry his tired body to the station. Whether the pipes did eat his caravan or not, this could have massive implications for trade. The man has been reprimanded for now, and a team sent to investigate the tunnel. The expedition team were greeted by the caravan. No bodies or blood or any sign of struggle. With only the pungent smell of rust and smoke polluting the dense air. The said station will be reinburst with more patrols, however the soldiers are somewhat reluctant to participate."

 HNZ_random_event.8.a:0 "I guess it worked, atleast"
