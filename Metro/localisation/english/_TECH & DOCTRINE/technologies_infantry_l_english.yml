  increase_scavenge_odds_5: "Scavenge Mission Success §G+5%§!"
  gas_mask_2013: "Basic Gas Mask"
  gas_mask_2013_desc: "A gas mask made for civilian use from before the war. They will keep a person safe from some contaminated environments, but are overall only hardly equipped to deal with the kind of places the Metro will put them up against."
  gas_mask_2029: "Improved Gas Mask"
  gas_mask_2029_desc: "An improved model of gas mask, making more dangerous areas accessible to scavengers and soldiers."
  gas_mask_2030: "Military-Grade Gas Mask"
  gas_mask_2030_desc: "A mask made specifically for the military, for use in protecting soldiers from field concentrations of chemical and biological agents, as well as radiological fallout particles."
  gas_mask_2031: "Cold-War Era Gas Mask"
  gas_mask_2031_desc: "Cold-War Era Gas Mask"
  gas_mask_2033: "Special Forces-Grade Gas Mask"
  gas_mask_2033_desc: "A gas mask which features improved performance against chemical and biological agents, toxic industrial chemicals, and nuclear fallout. Also, a higher field of view allowance. The mask also comes with a self sealing filter mount that allow for filter changes even in contaminated environments."
  gas_mask_2034: "Spartan-Grade Gas Mask"
  gas_mask_2034_desc: "These gas masks are much the same as the previous iteration of gas mask, however, they are reinforced and allow for more extended combat encounters without as much risk to them taking damage that would cause them to be unusable."
  gas_mask_2036: "Pre-War Gas Mask"
  gas_mask_2036_desc: "On the eve of war the Russian Government knew conflict was fast approaching. As a means to gain the technological edge over America they developed a new Gas Mask impervious to weather conditions and radiation. Knowing that war may very much be fought on Russian Soil, it was a last-ditch attempt to develop equipment which could be used in the eventuality of nuclear war. It only entered a prototype stage, and intended usage to be used in Siberia and the Artic Circle where America was believed to stage landing invasions through discrete operations. No more than several of these exist, and only a handful were ever produced. Destined to stay hidden behind closed doors."

  scrap_infantry_equipment_tech_1: "Ubonik"
  shotgun_infantry_equipment_tech_1: "Duplet"
  
  scrap_infantry_equipment_tech_2: "Finned Barrels"

  entrench_kits_2027: "Simple Militia Drills"
  entrench_kits_2027_desc: "The first and most important aspect of the modern metro soldier is discipline. The discipline to hold the line against mutants, the discipline to return fire instead of cowering in fear, and the discipline to follow orders without question. Without discipline, you cannot have an army."
  entrench_kits_2028: "Basic Militia Drills"
  entrench_kits_2028_desc: "Coordination is key, but does not come naturally. Men must be taught to understand orders, to speak only when needed to, and to work together in small units."
  entrench_kits_2029: "Advanced Militia Drills"
  entrench_kits_2029_desc: "Though most of our military is at this point a semi-professional militia, it's important to impose a certain standard of physical fitness, enough to manage long treks through the tunnels or to operate supply-bearing railcarts."
  entrench_kits_2030: "Rudimentary Army Drills"
  entrench_kits_2030_desc: "The transition from militia to professional army comes with many changes, the first of which is uniformity. Rag-tag self supplied kit is replaced with standardized uniforms, helmets, and boots."
  entrench_kits_2031: "Advanced Army Drills"
  entrench_kits_2031_desc: "Field fortification and entrenchment are both vital to defensive operations in the metro; even without dedicated engineer companies, soldiers are expected to know how to construct barricades, fill sandbags, and deploy razor-wire."
  entrench_kits_2032: "Comprehensive Army Drills"

  entrench_kits_2033: "Fundamental Special Forces Drills"
  entrench_kits_2033_desc: "Soldiers under the new training regimen will operate at the peak of human performance. (By Metro standards, anyway.) Long hikes through uninhabited tunnels, endurance training and strength building exercises are all things culiminating in our modern men of steel."
  entrench_kits_2034: "Complex Special Forces Drills"
  entrench_kits_2034_desc: "With the raised standards in the military, so too comes a raised degree of responsibilities and battlefield freedom. Group and Unit Leaders, who before would be left out of the planning stages, can now be relied upon to take objectives into their own hands."
  entrench_kits_2035: "Rigorous Special Forces Drills"
  entrench_kits_2035_desc: "Close Quarters Combat, or CQC for short is a constant issue in the Metro.

Drilling troops in both armed and armed melee combat will give them an invaluable set of skills."
  
  clothing_kits_2027: "Insulated Clothing"

  clothing_kits_2029: "Padded Clothing"
  clothing_kits_2029_desc: "While not bulletproof, padded clothes can mean the difference between getting the wind knocked out of you, and having your ribs broken. They're also great for insulating against the cold."
  clothing_kits_2031: "Basic Body Armor"
  clothing_kits_3021_desc: "Thin steel plates can be inserted into makeshift carriers and worn over the chest to protect from both blows in melee, and low caliber gunshots. Though heavy and unwieldy, these chestplates might just save your life."
  clothing_kits_2033: "Improved Body Armor"
  clothing_kits_2033_desc: "Salvaged Kevlar from from prewar body-armor can be fitted into well insulated clothes and recycled helmets. While these measures would still fold in the face of full rifle rounds, they provide excellent protection against pistol rounds and buckshot."
  clothing_kits_2035: "Heavy-Duty Armor"
  clothing_kits_2035_desc: "Full body suits of either Ceramic or steel plates. These massive unpowered suits can only be worn for a short time on the front, lest our men become fatigued."

spec_ops_equipment_2_tech:0 "Ceramic Ballistic Plating"
spec_ops_equipment_2_tech_desc:0 "Compared against Steel plating, Ceramic plating provides a much greater capacity to reduce the risk of ricochet bullets. Furthermore with a lighter weight it doesn't give our special forces a cumbersome fit. Also Not to mention the decreased risk of plate fragmenting when directly fired upon."

spec_ops_equipment_3_tech:0 "Webbing Storage"
spec_ops_equipment_3_tech_desc:0 "A shoulder harness which contains various pouches and storage pockets which allows the carrying of ammunition, medical supplies and other various pieces of tat our special forces may need out in the field. Aiding them in their ability to effectively fight."

spec_ops_equipment_5_tech:0 "Geiger Counter"
spec_ops_equipment_5_tech_desc:0 "Despite its urgency of being a stable supply in the apocalypse, we have only yet to roll them out to our special forces. It shouldn't be questioned that they provide a useful array of benefits to our forces; from scouting to being wary of radiation hazards."

It was based upon previous pre-war schematics and plans to give various branches of the Russian Armed Forces specialised gear which monitored their vitals when in battle. Dispensing morphine and other substances to prolong fighting capabilities. This technology was cut short; severely underfunded at the dawn of the third world war, and further itterations of the technology lost.But previous, alpha-builds of the equipment still exists. They can be put to good use."

spec_ops_equipment_9_tech:0 "Combat Sim"
