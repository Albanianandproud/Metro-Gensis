  politics_KRY_vishin_desc:0 "Before the bombs dropped Vishin found himself meandering from one occupation to the next. Being the son of a former Colonel in the Soviet Army he always felt he had something to live up to. Feeling dejected from not being able to follow in his fathers footsteps.\n\nNow? He lives life with a clear purpose; to defend §Yhis§! station. §YHis§! family. §YHis§! home. He will personally see to it that §YKrylatskoye§! station remains safe and secured from outside threats. And with reports of §RMutants§! in the tunnels to the south, he will do whatever it takes to live up to his fathers legacy."

  politics_KRY_jean_desc: "After storming Strogino station he and his boys have decidedly come to an agreement. Why skin the poor saps of the Metro when you can just milk them for what they're worth? Running from stations, slithering between the cracks and hiding down corridors. It ain't the bandit triangle, but with some spit and elbow grease his turf will be looking like a great place."
