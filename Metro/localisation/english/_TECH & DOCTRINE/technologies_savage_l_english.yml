   savage_society_tech_1: "Flint Knapping"

   savage_society_tech_2: "Specialized Toolset"

   savage_tech_4a: "Bone Flakes"
   savage_tech_4a_desc: "Weapons are designed to last and withstand constant usage - but what if they were crafted with the purpose to fracture? Barbed and Tanged Bone scraps which are fastened to a weapon with the intention to flake off upon impact increases its effectiveness as a weapon in combat."

   savage_ranged_equipment_2_tech: "Paralysis Concoction"
   savage_ranged_equipment_2_tech_desc: "Blowgun ammunition on its own is ineffective at dropping targets larger than mere rodents.
