 nf_GWC.1.t:0 "For Faith and Desperation"

 nf_GWC.1.d:0 "The stations which the Great Worm cult call home are not blessed with an abundance of food, in fact due to to the primitive ways of the cult, the potential for farming is flatly rejected. Instead hunting has replaced all other forms of food gathering, aside from a small amount of scavenging the crops of other stations and the native fungi of the Metro. This issue has found a partial solution in the full born embracing of cannibalism, and the kidnapping of unlucky refugees and individuals who dare to disturb the Great Worm. Of course, any captured children are inducted into the cult, but those who have reached puberty and beyond find themselves being the main dish at the many cultist barbecues across their cursed stations. Cultist hunting parties will go through the tunnels to the surrounding stations, and simply treat any 'Machine Men' that they find as just another animal to hunt, to skin, and to eat. However, the cult prefers to take in its victims alive, as that will ensure the freshness of the meat, and please the Great Worm so the Machine Men can properly be disposed of. Taking them alive is achieved through the use of poisoned blowguns, as the cult strongly avoids the use of firearms due to their religious primitivist beliefs, or through the simple use of a club to the head. Although much of these practices are justified through the use of their faith, the cult is in fact completely reliant on cannibalism due to the isolated nature of their primary station, and the over-hunted animal population in their region. These constant kidnapping raids on the surrounding stations have made less and less people willing to take the tunnels that the cult operates in, and has resulted in the possibility of famine unless the cult can address the issue of the food supply. The Priests continue to preach as if there is no issue, but in truth the cult is doomed without either expansion or a more sustainable form of food."
