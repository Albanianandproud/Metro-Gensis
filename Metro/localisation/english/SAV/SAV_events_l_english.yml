 nf_SAV.2.t: "Satanist Raids"
 nf_SAV.2.d: "The Satanist forces of Timiryazevskaya have launched a covert attack on our station. Slipping through the darkness, their forces managed to slip through our defenses only to wreck havoc across our station. Despite being able to drive the thugs back, they managed to slither back largely unharmed, with captured cultists chosing to shoot or self inflict wounds upon themselves rather than to become prisoner.\nDespite being a victory against the forces of Darkness, the fact they managed to go by undetected has distraught our populace, and many feel unsafe."
 nf_SAV.2.a: "They will pay in time."
