 nf_RED.1.d:0 "Its no chance that the Red Line sprouted from the Sokolnicheskaya line. Every edifice and facade of the line finely detailed with statues of Stalin and Lenin. Monuments of once-revered saints lay as a surviving testament to the world before. Like Egyptian Tombs, its ephemeral aura of power drew in those far and wide; pilgrims to witness what was. Over a period of time awe became reverence, and finally devotion. With the world as we knew gone, and only those faded memories of the past existed. It gave hope; an opportunity to build a new socialist bastion, unshackled from the burdens of the past.\n\n Surving Komsomol figures and those who lived under the reign of socialism began to put in motion a socialist revival. Overthrowing local stations and installing revolutionary councils across the Sokolnicheskaya, declaring a first Interstational; their goal, uniting the entire metro under Communism. Andrey Moskvin was one such revolutionary, his robustness and vigour personally spearheading the revolution and soon found himself overseeing the newly-established revolution."

 nf_RED.2.d:0 "However, what first began as social upheaval became a full-scale war with the rest of the metro. Many stations opposed the desires of the newly-established Red Line. Those on an ideological basis. Capitalist stations and others opposed to the workers revolution. The forming station-state of the Hanseatic League, diametrically opposed the Red Line, leading a coalition of stations to fight against the Red Line. Thusly started one of the bloodiest conflicts in the entire metro. Bodies plunged into the meat grinder, and precious rescourse churned for the war effort. A stalemate of attritional warfare, with neither side yielding, but becoming weaker as the war elapsed. As the realisation that the dream of a united Metro under socialism was fading, unrest and mutinies began to arise from within. Ideological differences spurred on full-scale insurrection, those leaving the fight and establishing their own stations, weakening the Red Lines support for the war in the process."

 nf_RED.3.d:0 "As the war dragged on furtherm neither the Red Line, or the Hanza saw the possibility of victory against the other. Pouring every resource they could scrap to kill, maim and destroy the other side with the end result being the innevitable decay of both parties. As both nations began to crumble and rot from the inside from exhaustion. citizens and soldiers alike protesting against the war. Too arrogant to kneel to the mob, either side were unyielding to submit to a peace agreement. If the deal was unfavourable to the ideologcally-die hard amongst the ranks of each, it could lead to further disharm and spur more instability. Bot sides were too stubborn to come to peace, and only wished to proclaim a victory against the other.\n\nEventually however, peace was arranged in absolute secret. Andrey came to realize the war could never be won against the Coalition. With every victory piled up bodies, more wasted resources. Was this really the price to pay for socialism? However it was not his decision to go ahead with peace. It was not even his dismay over the war, it was infact his brothers own drive to declare peace.\n\n His Younger brother, Maxim Moskvin, who oversaw the peace talks, at first without Andrey's knowledge. The deal commenced; Ploshchad Revolyutsii was to be given to the Red Line from Arbat. Arbat received the Biblioteka Imeni Lenina with eventually was handed over to Polis. A guarentee of free-access was agreed upon by all parties. The Red Line was cut in half. Andrey was championed by the people and the party alike for the peace. The inner circle of 'hard-blooded' socialists scorn at what they deemed a 'betrayal' of the revolution. Whilst unknowing that it was Andrey's own brother Maxim being the true negotiator of peace. A starting point which planted his brothers growing resentment towards him."

 nf_RED.4.d:0 "Andrey, a member of the revolutionary council, now saw himself as the General Secretary of the Red Line. Despite there being other competitors to that mantle, his will and tenacity saw him take to the mantle of leadership. His rule soon became unquestioned. Now in 2028 as the ashes of the Hanseatic Redline conflict begin to settle. The Red Line finds itself ever increasingly sliding into a more dire situation. The Sokolnicheskaya finds itself ina  precarious position which must be adressed with delicate hands. Many issues plague the nation, more within than without. The economy has grown stagnant, a policy of confiscation of resources levied for our military is still practised, making our economy unable to grow and develop from a subsistence basis. Neglect over the governments willingness to handle this, spurred on by the military's bloated control over all facets of business and daily industry has spiraled into the commonfolk slowly detesting the local powers which be. Even with hushed whispers against the state itself. These issues have only grown and festered in recent months.\n\n This is not the only problems to face us however. The Fascists pigs of Tverskaya have recently become invigorated thanks to their new Fuhrer. Scuffles on the tunnels between us has only increased from sporadic conflicts within recent weeks. Like the Great Patriotic War of old, we once fought and defeated them like. But it took a great deal of sacrifice. A monumental effort of blood and iron. Something way may not be able to affort right now.\n\n We are the heirs of the Soviet Socialist Union. Lenin's will will not snuffed out!"

Most resources which haven't been allocated to the Military, or distributed to our R&D is used to resuscitate our stagnant economy. A more direct approach is needed; instead of resources being spent to just 'patch up' the bloating issue, a new method is needed.\n\n Two solutions have been proposed. Firstly is the implementation of grants and other schemes aimed towards improving our station adimistrations effectiveness at handling local issues. Secondly a more fundamental solution is prioritising funds aimed at growing our primary industries such as construction and farming. Being able to be self sufficient and support itself and future growth."

 nf_RED.6.d:0 "Our military. Once before the war the Soviet Union had one of the biggest and strongest armies in the entire world. Its armed forces were equipped with the latest and deadliest weapons of war, and drilled second to none. From the Taiga of Siberia to the Baltics Russia was supreme. The Army both protected, and preserved its workers and ideals. But now today it seems that is the other way around\n\n Through a long line of inner decay the military has slowly withered and fractured to bickering factions within the Military. Despite the sheer volume of manpower at its disposal the lack of proper training procedures, and even pressing disregard for any combined communication between commanders ensures the military remains isolated and bloated. Poor logistics and not to mention the severe corruption which is profoundly showcased with the high command. Outfitted in regalia and adorned with dozens of medals, most of which had not been awarded, but snatched from traders or scavenged. A military not of merit or skill but of arrogance, parading as generals."

 nf_RED.7.d:0 "Grain requesitioning is a double-edged sword. Provding our troops with the much needed supplies in times of strife such as the Hansa war. A war exclusively fought in little pockets ande distraught all across the metro. Supplies being moved to and from, by an organized method was difficult given the linear nature of the war. So the Army resorted to confiscating grain and other resources to boost their stocks.\n\n Whilst this indeed proved successful, it did however be too efficient. A reliance upon this tried-and true method persisted. However despite the war becoming a distant memory the Military still practises it to this day. One contributing factor as to why our economy is in such a slump.\n\n It'd be wise to demobilise our rate of conviscation, however its reliance upon times of War is not to be questioned, nor is it something to avoid when war does indeed becomes clear."

 nf_RED.8.d:0 "Maxim Moskvin, Andreys younger brother. Always in his shadow and always with a chip upon his shoulder. Maxim had always been jealous of his older brother. Andreys charm, his success and power. A brotherly relationship rotted and no more than simple rivalry.\n\n Was there any respect Maxim held for his older brother? Hard to tell, but that love had been weathered and had withered away over the years to nothing. The only memories Maxim could give of their youth wasn't the bond they once shared, careless children but the bitter resentment he held.\n\n Despite this, Moskvin holds to him his own talents. He may never be anything like is more talented brother. But Maxim holds to him a resolve that few could attain. A strong brow, and an unquestioned authority few could dare to go against. Self confidence and true to ones self. Arrogance? possibly, but someone to lead, a figurehead."

It was him alone, with his reputation underneath his belt which ensured Andrey his current position of power. Kovshov is a die-hard communist much alike Moskvin, and the two ideals co-align. However Kovshov firmly believes in the power of the sword, whilst Andrey with recent years believing more so in the capabilities of the pen itself.\n\nKovshov staunchly believes that the Red Line at its current state is able to contest and fight against the Hansa. Hansa is weak, and inefficient at completely holding the ring line itself. Only through lightning action and conflict can the Red Line preserve its position. It is boxed in, corned by foes all around. Kovshov also insists upon removing, or limiting power the fickle politburo. With a personal grudge for pencil-pushers and other bureaucrats. His ire drawn towards the Central Metro Command in its early days, joining Andreys revolt against the inefficient CMC.\n\nViktor is not too keen upon these recent changes, to say the least. Removing the influence of the military and replacing it with a centralised power structure which answers the general secretariat and his officials. No longer two entities but inseperable. Kovshov fears, like from history past. First, Perestroika, then Glasnot and finally the state crumbles under a tide of uncertainty. If... and when the government will stray away from its own ideals.

 nf_RED.31.d:0 "Soviet Russia championed within Arts and Culture. Intangibly connected within the propaganda machine of the state and invigorating the peoples to achieve far beyond any mortal scope. Ofcourse we are not simple savages and its clear that the Red Line could pioneer once again within injecting funds into the arts and cultural institutions."

 nf_RED.33.t:0 "Maxims Talents"
 nf_RED.33.d:0 "It has become a topic of hot debate between Andreys close committee. His brother on one hand, has grown with remarkable reputation amongst the lower military command. His recent handling of the Military has only proven this. New recruits idolizing him just as much as the commonfolk would with Andrey. Maxim is not a remarkable man in his own right, but is loyalty to the Red Line is one thing. With brotherly ties between Andrey and Maxim would ensure no trechary could take place. Maxim has often suggested and wished for a position of power and influence. To lead. Assigning him as the role of General of the Armed forces could give him just that. Its known that Maxim is disgruntled with petty jealousy over his older brother. Perhaps this new position would give him just what he wants?"

 nf_RED.34.d:0 "As the mutineers falter, a recent plot has been unveiled by our Security Forces. There still exist many tunnels and utility lines which have yet to be claimed or explored. Some infested with mutants, bodies or other such horrible things. Whilst a fair few of them are being used as supply lines to fund the military mutineers. Its clear, that they're unable to fully produce and supply their own forces, furthermore accentuated by reports of their own forces being supplied by an external source who use secret tunnels to ferry weapons back and forth. The question is, who are supplying them?"
 nf_RED.34.a:0 "Probably Nothing to worry"
 nf_RED.34.b:0 "Those damn bandits!"
 nf_RED.34.c:0 "Those damn revolutionaries!"

 nf_RED.35.t:0 "Mutinies in the Mutiny"
 nf_RED.35.d:0 "Those mutineers have broken off away from the common rabble of the others, and have turned to pillaging and raiding the far tunnels. Making meager scraps and in turn slowly turning to banditry to fend for themselves. With the main mutineers becoming less of a threat, these bandits may become a more pressing issue with needs to be dealt with in due time."

 nf_RED.36.d:0 "The Armory Station makes its living selling armaments to the rest of the metro. Not only armaments but medical supplies, ammunition and other equipment ensuring the gears of war work flawlessly. The Red Line has always considered the Technicians of Kuznetsky Most friends of the Red Line, and mutual trade often takes place between the two. Red Line providing food and raw materials whilst the Technicians unsuprisingly provide guns for our troops.\n\nThere are many within Kuznetsky-Most who sympathise with the plight of the Red Line, and the two stations enjoy relative mutual respect for one another"

 nf_RED.40.d:0 "The Comrade Beria Corrective Labor Camp, or The Berilag. It is located at the station "Ulitsa Podbelskogo". Designed to contain red line enemies. It may also be used for other such purposes. Furthering our own Research and Development capabilities and serving as a means to dabble into more unconventional fields of research away from the public eye"
 nf_RED.40.a:0 "The Berilag is to be established"

 nf_RED.52.t:0 "Dry Station Bandits"
 nf_RED.52.d:0 "The Bandits of the Dry station; former Red Line soldiers and other dregs that the military pressed into service during the Hansa war. No more than thugs than a disciplined force, yet gouging themselves with armaments and weapons pinched from the Red Line as they turned their backs upon the Revolution for Personal profit.\n\nTheir Leader, dubbed simply as Master was once a low-ranking Officer, although recollection is still hazy and muddled. Having more of an ideological backbone - or just a fascination compared to the rest of his peers. Running his own station more like a boot-camp than a band of brigadiers. Although its clearly yet to be shown upon the tenacity of the troops. Being caught off guard by our forces. They shouldn't pose much of a threat. However their explosive equipment is a force to be reckoned with."
 nf_RED.52.a:0 "Turncoats of the Red Line are to be put to the sword"

 nf_RED.53.t:0 "Removal of Dry Station Bandits"
 nf_RED.53.d:0 "The Masters body was found stretched out lying amongst the wreckage of his personal quaters alone. A bullet must have bounced off from a nearby wall which had hit him directly in the chest. Bleeding out and succumbing to his wounds as the firefight continued to rain hell in the station. Amusingly dying as he lived; cowardly and craven.\n\nDespite their leaders passing, the bandits still continued to put up much resistance. Cordoning much of the Station and retreating to each subsequent level as Red Line forces advanced. Fears that as a last resort the bandits would collapse the whole station were put at ease, as the bandits made headway to their last redoubt. One-by-one picked off and as the last remained, only a few escapees could flee into the deep darkness of the tunnels to be never seen again."

 nf_RED.54.t:0 "Positive Heroism"
 nf_RED.54.d:0 "Disciplined and heroic even in the face of adversity, the citizens of the Red Line are tireless; Neither sweat nor toil can dissuade them. Those that plant olive trees in places they will never be able to sit under. Establishing a Socialist Utopia of for those of tomorrow."

Not just the odd stalker from the Sokolnicheskaya, but fully-equipped survey squads. If this is indeed correct, this means that the Red Line are looking for a way across the bridge."
 nf_RED.64.a:0 "We are ready for them"

 nf_RED.65.t:0 "Radio Jammers"
 nf_RED.65.d:0 "The Red Line have deployed radio interceptors to fry our transmissions between base to our stalker teams. Communication is already difficult in the field, but now our teams are completely naked out on the desolate and harsh surface. No communication will make spotting any Red Line encroachment difficult for the time being, until we can properly decrypt our transmissions."

 nf_RED.66.t:0 "Explosion at Sparrow Hills"
 nf_RED.66.d:0 "Whether one of our soldiers accidentally activated a IED, or whether by University hands, there was an explosion at Sparrow Hills bridge. A large chunk of the bridge collapsing into the freezing waters below.No evacuation could be properly made as the explosion was sudden\n\n The Bridge was already poorly maintained, furthermore adding strain upon our logistics down there. The bridge is not fully collapsed however, but will be difficult to properly move troops across for the forseeable future."

 nf_RED.77.t:0 "Blood Brothers"
 nf_RED.77.d:0 "The two brothers had finally met after so long. It had been an eternity since the two of them had done so. Not in some stuffy boiler room deciding the fate of traitors, or on a perched, ramshackle balcony watching battlions of troops march in an overwhelming show of dominance and loyalty to the Red Line. Just the two. To sit and chat and dine like brothers. And in the end? Through it all? the schemes and underhanded play, Andrey still loved his brother no more than anything else in this world. He remembered fondly of the time the two would play together as kids. A happy youth few will remember, or would ever have again. The bond the two had, and shared had now rotted away. A festering carcass of bitterness and resentment. The glorious days in contrast with the drab room. Those days of brotherly love was gone. \n\n§tMaxim, brother! I'm so pleased that we finally made up. It was a fight over nothing. Let's have a drink!§!\n\nAs his brother raised his glass in a toast, and sipped upon the Mushroom Tea, Maxims face stood firm. Through the 20 years of struggle and toil. Of always being in his brothers shadow. The insurmountable scorn and envy he had dealt with, all manifested to this moment. But he yielded not even a flinch. Watching, observing as his brother succumbed to the poison. Gagging gasping upon the floor as Andrey gave his last dying gasps for life. Not a word."

 nf_RED.78.t:0 "Brother"
 nf_RED.78.d:0 "What did he have to show for all the bodies littering the station gaps and misery he's caused? Lonely and relegated to being a tool manipulated by higher forces that be. His own son disgusted by his father, resenting him. The corrupt and laughing-stock of a Socialist State is still corrupt just as the day he became General Secretary. Enemies lay all around, within and without which will snuff out the Revolution for good.\n\nMaxim's whole life was swallowed by grief and bitterness towards his brother. Always wanting something more from life, no amount of power or vanity could fill that void. He has no glory day to reminisce about, because he never found any fufillment from life. Not with his brother, not before the war. A pitiful loser. Who will eventually find himself behind the barrel of an up and coming rival."
