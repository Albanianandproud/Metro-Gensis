 nf_RED.73.d: "Election date draws on the horizon\nDuring the revolution against the Central Metro Command, revolutionary organizations were formed all across the Redline. It was decided, every decade from these fledgling stations to decide on the next Chairman to spearhead the revolution. In the aftermath of the Hansa-Redline war, said mantra continued to be maintained. Andrey won last election by a long margin. Now he is set to run once again."

That day soo draws near"

 nf_RED_election_system.2.t: "Maxim Moskvin Seeks to Run as General Secretary"
 nf_RED_election_system.2.d: "It appears that that Moskvin, the brother to general secretary, seeks to run for General Secretary of the Red Line. A relatively new face to appear amongst the higher crust of the Red Line political party. He had grown a reputation amongst the younger members of the komsomol, especially within the Military. His actions against the diminished Junta propelling his newfound political career. However considering now it is very much brother pitted against brother, it is uncertain whether the sibling bond between the two will rot away."

The two argued long into the night over policies and the future regarding the Red Line. Although the semantics of the moment raged, it was obviously clear the dialogue meandered from politics to bitter resentment between the two. Vehemence beyond words erupted between the two leaving Moskvin enraged and who left the office in a furious storm. Since then the two have yet to meet and discuss like they had used to. Regardless of whether Maxim was running out of spite, or from own aspirations, it now seems he is determined to best his brother in the ballot box."

  nf_RED_election.1.t: "Elections draw near"
  nf_RED_election.1.d: "After the conclusion of the Hanza-Redline war, it was firmly agreed upon that each successive Secretary General would serve for a decade. No more or less. After their term is concluded an election would take place amongst the various station chiefs and members of the Politburo to decide upon the next General Secretary. Andrey is determined to continue faithfully serving the proletariat of the Redline, and seeks to run for the position once again. However within recent months, and not to mention in the aftermath of the failed Military revolts there is a growing amount of disatisfaction with his rule."

Slated to occur in §C2033§!. §YAndrey Moskvin§!, and his brother §YMaxim Maxim§! will be pitted against one another to decide who is the more capable brother to lead the §R[RED.GetName]§!. The option to nudge the chances of either brothers success is available through the §CDecisions Tab§! For more Information."

  nf_RED_election.2.t: "Brothers War"
  nf_RED_election.2.d: "From what it seems to suggest, Maxim and Andrey have seem to have fallen out. Following a heated debate prolongued over the course of several hours. The two clashed inside Andreys office. The brothers argued long into the night over policies and future regarding the Redline, and Maxims gambit to run for General Secretary. Although the semantics of the moment raged. It was obstencibly the case that the dialogue meandered from politics to bitter diatribe between the two. Maxim engulfed in a fit of rage left the office. Since then the two have refused to see one another. Regardless of whether Maxim was running out pure of spite, or from his own aspirations, it now seems he is determined to best his brother in the ballot box."
  nf_RED_election.2.a: "Andrey is no longer fit as General Secretary, his time is over!"

  nf_RED_election.3.t: "The Target of Slander"
  nf_RED_election.3.d: "In a recent incident, Maxim has taken to attempting to tarnish his brothers legitimacy to lead. Rather than proping up his own attributes as a fitting candidate for General Secretary, instead hurling diatribe towards Andreys past tenure. Perhaps after the recent fallout the two brothers had, this rhetoric is more bitter than it is genuine. However in turn many of those who have felt disatisfied with Andreys rule has flocked to Maxim, garnering their support to his candidacy."
  nf_RED_election.3.a: "If even his own brother condemns him, then his rule must be terrible"

  nf_RED_election.11.t: "Assuring the Loyalty of the Military"
  nf_RED_election.11.d: "It was clear that the Redline strayed from its destined path. Perhaps many amongst the military, even after the failed attempts to coup Andreys reign understood this. Loyaltys to Kovshov and his ilk had been purged, but sympathies to him still remained hushed behind closed doors. Maxim Moskvin had showed talent during the crisis. His brother may have neglected the cry of the military. But his brother, seeking to undermine him would not. Whilst the Military were far removed from the innter politiking of the Redline; and neither did they care for it. Winning their favour would propel Maxims chance, and in return disuade their support for Andrey. If any were still prevalent."
  nf_RED_election.11.a: "Andreys friends in the army were few and far between"
  nf_RED_election.11.b: "Moskvin found allies amongst the commanders of the Army"
  nf_RED_election.11.c: "Maxims staunch resolve yielded the military their respect"

  nf_RED_election.12.t: "Loyalty of the Apparatchik"
  nf_RED_election.12.d: "The apparatus of the Redline works tirelessly day and night to ensure the inner gears of the Party and the state operate seamlessly. Much to no ones surprise, their support would undoubtedly gravitate the outcome of the election in whoevers favour they deem is capable. Winning their support almost seems necessary as winning the support of the proletariat."
  nf_RED_election.12.a: "Much to anyones surprise, the Apparatchik found support in Moskvin"
  nf_RED_election.12.b: "A surprise to be seen, many found support for Moskvins gambit"

  nf_RED_election.14.t: "FSB and their support"
  nf_RED_election.14.d: "The KGB, FSB or simply state security are the main apparatus of the state to keep the denizens of the Redline in check. More crucial to the operation of the General Secretary or the Military. The FSB are a vital artery of maintaining power which they freely exercise at the drop of a hat. Their support may be more important than anything else. Especially their current leader, Cheslav Andreevich Korbut who in the past has given his sympathies to Moskvins gambit for General Secretary."
  nf_RED_election.14.a: "We do not require Korbuts Assistance."
  nf_RED_election.14.b: "The FSBs help is much appreciative"
  nf_RED_election.14.b_korbut: "Korbut will help Maxim win favour of the Redline, improving his odds in the Election!"

  nf_RED_election.15.t: "Korbut seeks to lend Assistance"
  nf_RED_election.15.d: "With the FSB seemingly yielding their support to Moskvin, Korbut has seemingly taken a keen interest in the election candidacy. Whether to pursue his own political agenda, or genuinely seeking to prop up Moskvin in the coming election. Korbut has given his support to Maxim, rather than towards his brother. Offering to help 'tweak' the balance of the election through lobbying much of the Politburo into Moskvins favour."
  nf_RED_election.15.a: "Korbuts help could indeed come in handy"
  nf_RED_election.15.a_tt: "Korbut shall assist in helping Maxim win the election. However a price shall be paid for this meddling. A large price."
  nf_RED_election.15.b: "I can win this election on my own."
  nf_RED_election.15.b_tt: "Maxim will attempt to win the election through sheer wit. However Korbut will still lurk in the shadows."

  nf_RED_election.16.t: "Idus of the Revolution"
  nf_RED_election.16.d: "Korbut approached Maxim once again. Knowing full well the current situation facing the Redline, and Andrey himself planted firmly as the root and cause of it all.\n\n§tI overheard one conversation between your brother and his advisor.. about the threat you pose and ways to eliminate it.§! With that, Korbut usurped Maxims mind and planted it with delusions. But Korbut would give him a taste for power, only to further his own career. His plan to remove Andrey would be put in motion.\n\n"
  nf_RED_election.16.a: "Those Documents shall Damn Andrey"
  nf_RED_election_16.a_tt: "§YKorbut§! will pull his strings to propel §YMaxim§! into becoming the next General Secretary. The Election will swing significantly in §YMaxims§! favour!"
  nf_RED_election.16.b: "With Korbuts advice, Maxim paid his brother a visit"
  nf_RED_election_16.b_tt: "§R...There is no going back from this decision§!."

  nf_RED_election.17.t: "Blood Brothers"
  nf_RED_election.17.d: "The two brothers finally met. It had been an eternity since the two of them had done so. Not in some stuffy boiler room deciding the fate of traistors, or perched upon a balcony watching parades of soldiers goostep by. Just the two. To sit. To chat and dine like brothers. And in the end of it all? Through all the schemes and underhanded play between the siblings, Andrey still loved his brother. He remembered fondly of those times the two as children. A happy youth seldom few remembered and even fewer could ever have again. The bond between the brothers once shared between either of them had rotted away. The glorious days of the Line had deteriorated. The brotherly love was gone.\n\n§tMaxim, brother! I'm so pleased that we finally made up. It was a fight over nothing! Let's have a drink!§!\n\nAs his brother raised his glass in a toast, and sipped upon the Mushroom Tea, Maxims face stood firm. Through the 20 years of struggle and toil. Of always being in Andreys shadow. The insurmountable envy he had dealt with, all manifested to this moment. But he yielded not even a flinch as he watched on, observing as his brother succumbed to the poison. Gagging and gasping upon the floo, Andrey gave his last dying gasps for life. And not a word. It was done."
