 nf_SPT.1.t:0 "Resource Shortages"
 nf_SPT.1.d:0 "Hello Colonel Sir. As you currently know our current operations lay outside the jurisdiction of Polis. Whilst we may rely on their political support, we are in dire need of resources. Our technicians require many pieces of tooling which our new base of operation simply lacks. Polis' council assistance with resources is doubtful, and our military feels the squeeze from the lack of equipment. They won't hide their discontent for much longer. Whilst we may trade for required resources with Hansa or Arbat, a much ideal solution is to trek out onto the surface and find them ourselves. We are the Rangers, we should not be tethered to one polity for support.\n\nWe have found several key locations which are a great place to begin salvaging efforts. I hope you trust our plan, Colonel sir."

They key sites we had initially planned to salvage from remained initially intact. Other than erosion from weather and debris they were left untouched. We'll be able to set up a rudmientary outpost in this spot for the meantime, and carry resources back and to our station. This should surely help ameliorate our resource shortages."

 nf_SPT.15.d:0 "Within the clandestine depths of the Spartan Rangers' enclave, an unspoken tension simmers as the balance of power teeters on the edge between Colonel Miller and the enigmatic figure known as Hunter. The Metro, a labyrinth of shadows and uncertainty, becomes the backdrop for a silent struggle, played out in the exchange of wary glances and the weight of unspoken words.\n\nColonel Miller, a symbol of authority clad within the Order's ranks, stands as the embodiment of the established order. His words carry the weight of experience and strategy, guiding the Rangers through tumultuous times. In the dim light of the command center, the Colonel articulates decisions with conviction, advocating for diplomacy and alliances in the face of the Metro's ever-present threats.\n\nContrastingly, Hunter, wearing battle-worn attire and bearing the scars of countless engagements, embodies the feral essence of survival in the Metro. Silent and inscrutable, he watches from the shadows, his loyalty undeniably fierce but harboring an innate distrust for the diplomatic path advocated by the Colonel. The man's unspoken reservations cast a palpable tension that echoes through the enclave.\n\nThe balance of power hangs in the balance as the Rangers, torn between the Colonel's calculated approach and Hunter's survival instincts, navigate the treacherous currents of the Metro's political landscape. Each decision, each alliance, is a piece in the intricate chess game unfolding beneath the surface, determining the fate of the Spartan Rangers and the very essence of survival in the post-apocalyptic realm.\n\nAs the Rangers find themselves at the crossroads of diplomacy and raw, unbridled strength, the unsettled balance of power between Colonel Miller and Hunter becomes a silent struggle, a dance of shadows that will shape the destiny of the Metro and its warriors. The outcome remains shrouded in uncertainty, hidden within the depths of the tunnels, waiting to be revealed in the unforgiving embrace of the Metro's relentless challenges."

 nf_SPT.16.t:0 "The Colonel Holds On"
 nf_SPT.16.d:0 "In the subdued glow of the Spartan Rangers' command center, a sense of order and unity prevails as Colonel Miller emerges victorious in the silent struggle for power. The Order of Sparta, once rife with uncertainty, now resonate with the Colonel's calculated strategy, and a delicate harmony begins to settle among the ranks.\n\nColonel Miller, standing tall in his Colonel uniform, carries an air of authority sharpened by experience. The soldiers, with a nod of acknowledgment, align themselves with the established order. The diplomatic path, symbolized by the alliance with Tushino, becomes a beacon of hope as the Rangers prepare to face the enemy threats with a united front.\n\nAs the Colonel addresses the soldiers, his words resonate with conviction, emphasizing the strength derived from cooperation and the wisdom found in strategic alliances. The once-muted dissenting whispers are replaced by a shared sense of purpose, a commitment to navigate the perils of the Metro under the Colonel's seasoned leadership.\n\nIn the shadows, Hunter's feral gaze, while still guarded, hints at a begrudging acceptance. The balance has shifted, and the harmony brought by Colonel Miller's triumph becomes the new melody in the Metro's symphony of survival. The Spartan Rangers, though diverse in their backgrounds and perspectives, now stand united, a formidable force against the encroaching darkness.\n\nThe victory of Colonel Miller signifies not just a triumph of strategy but a testament to the resilience of order in the face of chaos. As the Rangers prepare for the challenges ahead, the corridors of Arbatskaya and Smolenskaya echo with a newfound sense of stability, where the shadowed struggle for power has yielded to a collective purpose under the steady hand of Colonel Miller's leadership."

 nf_SPT.17.t:0 "The Master of the Hunt"
 nf_SPT.17.d:0 "In the heart of the Spartan Rangers' enclave, a seismic shift resonates through the shadows as Hunter, emerges triumphant in the silent struggle for leadership. The Rangers, once a bastion of order under Colonel Miller, now bears witness to an uncertain future as Hunter takes the reins, his survivalist instinct guiding the destiny of the Spartan Rangers.\n\nHunter now stands at the forefront, a symbol of the Metro's untamed spirit. The soldiers, their loyalty now pledged to their leader, absorb the unspoken promises of a different path. As Hunter addresses the assembled Rangers, his voice, a growl of determination, resonates through the station. The call to strength, survival, and an embrace of the Metro's inherent brutality becomes the new rallying cry. Dissenting whispers, now muted, acknowledge the shift in power, as the Spartan Rangers prepare to face the mutant threat with a leader who thrives in the unforgiving depths.\n\nIn the shadows, Colonel Miller, Anna, and Artyom exchange knowing glances. The decision is made. The path forged by Hunter's leadership does not align with their vision for the Metro's future. As the enclave adapts to the new leadership, the trio of former Rangers, bound by familial and ideological ties, takes their leave, disappearing into the tunnels with a sense of solemn resignation.\n\nThe Metro, in the aftermath of Hunter's ascent, becomes a realm of uncertainty and untamed potential. The Spartan Rangers, under their new leader, navigate a path that reflects the raw, primal essence of survival. "

Just a lowly soldier in the grand scheme of things.\n\nI can't deny the fear that creeps up on me as we move through those tunnels. We are meant to be elite soldiers, second to none, and yet I still feel unease. The air is thick with a mix of staleness and the stench of things gone wrong. Mutants lurk around every corner, their eerie growls echoing in the darkness. We tread carefully, weapons ready, eyes wide open.\n\nThe Colonel talks about restoring order and reclaiming Arbatskaya for humanity. It's a noble cause, but down here, it's hard not to feel like a tiny speck against the overwhelming odds. Each step feels like a gamble, and the weight of the mission hangs heavy on my shoulders.\n\nAs we delve deeper, the shadows seem to dance around us, and I can't help but wonder if we're making a difference or just stirring up the hornet's nest. The outcome of this mission is uncertain, and as a recruit, all I can do is follow orders and hope that Colonel Miller's determination will see us through the abyss of Arbatskaya."

 nf_SPT_FLAVOR.2.d:0 "In the gritty heart of the fight in Arbatskaya, a young, freshly green recruit found themselves in the midst of a visceral spectacle. Amidst the chaos, the private's gaze fell upon a figure both fearsome and repulsive the Spartan warrior known simply as "Hunter."\n\nDraped in his grimy stalker gear that bore the stains of countless battles, Hunter moved through the darkness with a wild and untamed energy. His face was marred by scars and filth, and it only intensified the aura of ferocity that surrounded him. It was a stark departure from the handsome, cleanly kept stereotype of the Spartans, yet Hunter exuded an undeniable prowess that spoke of survival in the harshest depths of the Metro.\n\nIn the brutal ballet of combat, Hunter wielded his scoped VSV, with a blood-soaked bayonet fixed to the end of it. Each thrust of the bayonet made a bloody mess of the mutants around him. The injured private, crouched behind debris, observed as Hunter decimated any mutant that dare try to touch him. In an ironic way, he was more feral and animal-like then any of the mutants before him. The private admired Hunter's combat spirit, and it was sure to leave a lasting impression on him."

 nf_SPT_FLAVOR.3.d:0 "Amidst the Spartan Rangers' command tent, a tense atmosphere hangs heavy as Hunter, and a group of his followers voice their discontent with the Colonel's decision to throw support behind Tushino over the Mayday Republic. The air crackles with resentment as Hunter, adorned in his battle-worn attire, confronts the Colonel, expressing vehement opposition to the perceived strategic misstep.\n\nHunter argues that the Mayday Republic, with its militaristic stance, aligns more closely with the Spartan Rangers' ethos, offering a potential ally in the harsh landscape of the Metro. His followers, similarly bearing the scars of countless battles, nod in agreement, their loyalty torn between the enigmatic Hunter and the established chain of command.\n\nThe tension escalates as Hunter passionately asserts that aligning with Tushino, a less militaristic faction, jeopardizes the Rangers' survival in the unforgiving tunnels. He contends that the Mayday Republic, with its militaristic prowess, would be a stronger and more reliable ally, ensuring the safety of the Spartan Rangers in the face of looming threats.\n\nThe Colonel, resolute in their decision, faces a challenge from within their own ranks as Hunter's dissent threatens to fracture the unity of the Spartan Rangers. The outcome of this internal conflict could reshape the course of the Metro's political landscape. Hunter and his men eventually back off, but the stain on their relationship is for all to see."

 nf_SPT_FLAVOR.4.d:0 "In the gritty confines of Smolenskaya, we sit here waiting for orders, or anything to do, really. Suddenly, out of the shadows, Hunter strides in like a living legend, scars and all. He carries a bundled tarp, presumably full of weapons. Behind him, his crew's lugging an impressive haul of weapons – rifles, explosives, you name it.\n\nI'm just one of the grunts, hunkered down with the others, and as Hunter starts doling out the gear. I give a nod to the guy next to me, and we share a quiet "damn, Hunter's done it again" moment. His voice, all low and growly, fills the chamber as he recounts the trials of snagging these weapons from the depths of the Metro. "Got these babies from the darkest corners," Hunter grunts, his eyes flashing with that wild intensity. "Bandits, rival factions, you name it – we faced 'em all. But look what we got!"\n\nHis crew starts handing out rifles, explosives, and even a couple of banged-up shotguns. I snag a rifle, checking it over like it's the holy grail. "Damn, Hunter, you're a lifesaver," I mumble to myself. Hunter catches my eye, a rare moment where the man looks almost satisfied. "Survival ain't pretty, soldier. These weapons are tools for the fight ahead. Use 'em well." The camaraderie spreads as we gather around, swapping stories and admiring our new arsenal. Hunter, with that fierce grin of his, claps a hand on my shoulder. "We're in this together, pal. Metro ain't giving up without a fight, and neither are we."\n\nAs the weapons change hands and the clatter of loading magazines fills the air, there's a newfound sense of purpose. Hunter's return didn't just bring us arms; it brought a spark back to our ranks. In the midst of the Metro's darkness, Hunter stands as a reminder that even in this grim reality, a true warrior can emerge from the shadows, arms laden with hope for those who call the Metro home."

Their words resonate through the chamber as they articulate the dire situation, emphasizing the need for unity against the relentless mutant menace. The Mayday Republic, with its martial strength, is revealed as the chosen ally to bolster the Spartan Rangers' defenses.\n\nAs the soldiers absorb the weight of the decision, Hunter observes in the background. His feral gaze, usually inscrutable, flickers with a mixture of approval and determination. Dressed in his characteristic battle-worn attire, Hunter stands as a silent observer, his loyalty to the cause evident but shrouded in a layer of uncertainty.\n\nThe Colonel's speech echoes with rallying cries, extolling the virtues of cooperation and the strength forged through alliances.The chamber is silent as the Colonel concludes, the weight of their decision settling on the soldiers. Hunter, standing at the fringes, remains an enigma, his reactions hidden behind the mask of a feral warrior. The fate of the Spartan Rangers, entwined with the Mayday Republic, hangs in the balance, and as the soldiers disperse, the Metro's future is left to unfold in the wake of the Colonel's call to arms."
