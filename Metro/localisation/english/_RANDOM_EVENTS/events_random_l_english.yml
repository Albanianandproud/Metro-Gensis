 random_event_vagrants.01.d:0 "Noises are heard coming from deep in the tunnels, right on the border of our territory. The sound of incomprehensible muttering and voices, which appear to sound human. A team sent to investigate discovers the sound coming from a band of vagrants skulking in a maintenance hall to the side of the tunnel. There they have established a rudimentary camp. With only the belongings on their back as respite. Some of the members wielded rather crude, however sophisticated hand-weapons made from scrap. They speak in an unfamiliar language yet strangely greeted your team with open arms. As communication between the vagrants was established by using gestures and sign language you discover they originated from the southern Metro. They had lived from place to place, never stopping. Headed by their patriarch, who had recently passed following an encounter with a frightful demon they now find themselves leaderless and wish to settle down."

 random_event_glitters.01.d:0 "One of the tunnel guardmens swears he sees something shine in the darkness. Every rotation when he returns back to station he spots a shimmer from beyond the tunnel in one of the old maintenance side paths. He is unable to investigate since said tunnel has been boarded up, with only a slight glimpse to see through. The Tunnel in question was boarded up years ago due to mutant incursions deep in that tunnel. The man stands by his guns, saying it isn't the trick of the light or his imagination. There is something down there, and wishes to investigate."

 random_event_glitters.03.d:0 "The Wooden barricades were pryed open to reveal what was behind. Beyond the absolute void lay nothing. Where the soldier said he could spot the speckles of light laid nothing. A blackened circular shape imprinted on the floor and on the ceiling. It smelled like a mixture of burnt rubber and sulphur. Whilst strange to say the least, nothing of value was found. The barricade reinburst and quickly that tunnel was forgotten again."

 random_event_station_babbler.01.d:0 "A strange man has started to rant in the middle of the station. Whilst he is off of his work duties he'll stand, perched ontop of an old soap box and rant about the most amusing of topics. From fringe beliefs about how 'Eurasia will Unite' and Humanity must dig down to reach the legendary below-kingdom of Agartha. To more humorous topics such as the notion that the Metro was infact built by Intelligent Gnomes in the 4th century who used the metro system to hide and store their absurd amounts of Kvass. Whilst the children sit and listen to his insane babbles, many of our citizens deject it. They find his rants somewhat amusing. A tinfoil-wearing, but rather harmless old man"

 random_event_scientist.01.d: "One of our scienctists has proposed an idea to substantially boost our science base. However his experiments are deemed 'unorthodox' and extreme even by our standards. He reassures his research will only be used for the goodness of our administration, and means only to do well."

 random_event_printers.01.d: "Our stations printing organization has recently published several news articles critical of our current regieme.

 random_event_civics.01.d: "A child got distracted during work and suffered a fatal injury. I will share you the grizzly details, what is more pressing is the childs injury has sparked mass resentment in our citizenry regarding our policy on child labour. Perhaps as a means to save face, and to get back into the good graces of our populace we should yield to the mob?"
 random_event_civics.01.a: "Perhaps we should change our policy?"
 random_event_civics.01.b: "We don't have enough hands to meet labour demands. I'm sorry."

 random_event_civics.02.t: "A Desperate Mother"
 random_event_civics.02.d: "A mother has refused to let their child attent work in fear of them getting injured or worse. Station authorities are at standby willing to interviene. However this would undoubtedly cause alarm, and may further inspire resentment in our populace. Perhaps, we could look the other way and make an exception?"

 random_event_civics.04.d: "There has been an accident! A child worker was injured whilst at work. Despite attempts to save them, they ultimately did not pull through. Unsuprisingly this has sparked a time of mourning across the station where the accident took place. A makeshift cross has been erected where the child perished. People leaving few material tokens to mark their respect. Whats worse, is that this has sparked outrage also. Vandals have graffitied 'CHILD MURDERERS' along the station walls. Many citizens are distraught with the unfortunate accident, and this may spark more outrage towards our administration."
 random_event_civics.04.a: "We should change our policy this instant"

  ### War ###

  random_event_war.1.t: "Accusations of Draft Dodging!"
  random_event_war.1.d: "A recent scandal has been brought to light divulging that our Station Administration have been pulling strings to avoid sending their associates up to the draft. After being investigated for charges and subsequently aquited has only lead to a resounding uproar across our citizens. The recent misconduct of power could have serious reprecussions for our authority, and could perhaps sow the seeds of discontent among our population which could further be a disaster for the war effort."
  random_event_war.1.a: "Disgraceful, send them to the front"
  random_event_war.1.b: "Side with the administration"
  random_event_war.1.c: "The Enemy are on our doorstep, we have better things to prioritise!"
  random_event_war.2.t: "Question of Rationing"
  random_event_war.2.d: "The question which lies on the wordless lips of every one of our citizens. Our population is used to grueling hardships, especially now of all times when the enemy threaten to break down our very doorstep. However, with resources being directly pulled from the civilian sphere to support our lads fighting the question has been arisen of whether more resources should be allocated and tighter restrictions placed on scarce resources. This would surely be dissaproved by our population, but may win us the war."
  random_event_war.2.a: "This may be a necessary evil that we will have to commit to"
  random_event_war.2.b: "The war is going well, we do not need to jeopardize our conviction with the populace"
  random_event_war.3.t: "Resentment against Rationing"
  random_event_war.3.d: "With restrictions upon certain goods being put in place, rising discontent towards our current reigme has only festered. Reports of a rising 'black market' of sorts to circumvent resource-stamp system ennacted has only made our popularity fall amongst our citizenry as a result. Perhaps it is in our best interest take this into consideration and perhaps relax the current restrictions?"
  random_event_war.3.a: "Stop your whining, this is for your own good"
  random_event_war.3.b: "Perhaps a stepping restrictions back would be ideal"
  random_event_war.4.t: "Alarming News from the Front"
  random_event_war.4.d: "Recent reports coming from the front are distressing indeed. Whilst the war continues to rage with no explicit end in sight, our beleaguered soldiers are facing more difficult sorties by the day, and with casualties mounting. The battlefront can only be described simply as carnage. Shrapnel and bullet squelch and blanket the metro tracks and corpses far too decomposed and rotted to be identified left to fester and be eaten by rats.. Perhaps this is hell."
  random_event_war.4.a: "If our citizens sees those reports, they could condemn our war"
  random_event_war.4.b: "Do not let these reports come out!"
  random_event_war.5.t: "Reports from the Front"
  random_event_war.5.d: "Recent reports from the frontline have come through. Whilst the war still rages with no explicit end in sight, the actions of our soldiers can only be described as courageous. We should let their bravery and feats be known and perhaps it would further inspire committment towards our population"
  random_event_war.5.a: "This is what we needed"
  random_event_war.5.b: "We can spin this, somehow"

  ## detained

  random_event_detained.1.t: "Diplomatic Incident"
  random_event_detained.1.d: "A recent transgression has come to our attention. A diplomat sent on political relations to our station has recently gotten himself into hot water. If seeking to negotiate amiable political relations was drinking to his hearts content and pitching bar fights with patrons to go by then he infact is going a good job rousing the local populace. We have detained the drunken diplomat, however we cannot force any justice reprecussions on the individual. However throwing him out of our station may indeed sour our relations with the Diplomat as a result."
  random_event_detained.1.a: "Theres nothing we can do, which wouldn't cause diplomatic harm"
  random_event_detained.1.b: "Throw out the Diplomat"

  random_event_victory.1.d: "The War is over! A time to count of the cost of collateral, and human damage, reforge the peace and draw up plans for any future war. Our officials have suggested to [ROOT.GetLeader] to display our military might and prowess we should conduct a military parade in [ROOT.Capital.GetName], just like the military marches of old. It would undoubtedly serve to boost public morale."
  random_event_victory.1.a: "A display of our supreme authority and victory will surely suffice"
  random_event_victory.1.b: "Just a little public display will do"

 random_event_disappearance.01.d:0 "We have received a worrying report from one of our outposts on the border of our territory next to some abandoned Metro tunnels. According to the messenger, a routine patrol has failed to report for several days. While such an occurrence isn’t necessary alarming by itself, with guards often being delayed, forgetting to check in or outright deserting, the families of these men have reported them missing and are begging us to send someone to find out what happened.\n\nhe outpost commander has personally vouched for the loyalty and capability of these men, and requests that he be allowed to send another team to investigate the fate of the missing patrol, arguing if the cause behind the disappearance of the guards isn’t looked into, there is a possibility that we will suffer further casualties. Nonetheless, the final decision on whether to probe the tunnels remains with us."
 random_event_disappearance.01.a:0 "Tell the commander to investigate! We must bring those boys home"
 random_event_disappearance.01.b:0 "Better safe than sorry. Order the outpost commander to stay put"

After several hours, they came across the equipment of the missing patrol stashed away in a crevice. It is clear that this was done in a hurry – no effort was made to properly camouflage the abandoned weapons, hence allowing for its easy discovery by our team.\n\nWe cannot say for sure what happened to the missing patrol. Why they would decide to abandon their armour or weapons and flee further into the tunnels is beyond our understanding. The only clue that we have is the thick pungent of musk and sulphur that lingers in the tunnel."
 random_event_disappearance.02.a:0 "Dammit. Order the Team to return at once!"

 random_event_disappearance.03.t:0 "Lost Patrol Discovery"
 random_event_disappearance.03.d:0 "We have just received some fortunate news from our investigative team. After several hours, they were able to find the missing patrol hiding in a crevice in the abandoned metro tunnel, frightened and babbling incoherent nonsense, and were able to return them back to their outpost.\n\nOur interrogation of them to determine what happened hasn’t met much success, however. All we were able to glean from them is that while the guards were doing their routine patrol, they came across some tall slender humanoid like figures who were impervious to bullets. After attempts to put them down failed, the guards fled further into the tunnels and hid until we found them.\n\nThis explanation leaves us with more questions than answers. Who these humanoids are, what their intentions were and how they are able to be immune to our attacks is something that we will probably never know unless they reveal themselves once more."

Preying under the cover of darkness and gnawing their way through just about anything. Getting into our food supplies and feasting upon unwarying piglets. Even worrying reports is that they are unfased by any attempts of our civilians at scaring them off. Accounts even depicting them scurrying and gnawing at children and corpses. Whatever the case may be, more emphasis on rat catching must be put in motion."

 random_event_bad.2.t:0 "Bandit Ambush!"
 random_event_bad.2.d:0 "One of our Caravans were recently ambushed making its routinely trip between stations. Outgunned the caravaneers fled, leaving behind their likelyhood.

 random_event_bad.5.d:0 "One of our recently occupied stations has been suffering from anti-administrative partisans conducting sabotage operations. However in recent days their actions are primarily aimed at stalling our local station chiefs from effectively controlling the population of the state. The populace have become increasingly frustrated with our occupation, and whilst no outward conflict has spilled over, the current trajectory of the station almost makes it seem likely."

However the issue has only festered with the foes sabotaging our stations local workshops. The whole district was engulfed in flames from the ensuing fire, and whilst eventually the flames were quelled, what was left of was only ruins.

A sputter and a few heart-stopping whines later and the generator finally broke in a rather boring spectacle. Our engineers think they can replace much of the damaged parts, but the chance of the generator breaking down once more seems almost likely - when, rather than if."

Peeking inside the man discovered inside dozens of bottles of vodka and other assorted alcohol. Whether dropped by some caravan, or bandit or what else. Sampling its content right there on the spot, the man took what he could. Saving some of the bottles for himself. Donating the rest to our administration as a gesture of goodwill, or a ploy as to get himself off of guard duty. Its ours for the taking!"

A trivial discussion one moment broke into petulant insults the next as the commander gets up onto his feet. Kicking off into a fist fight between one of the off-duty sentries. Each punch and riposte shove landed with cracking ferocity. Surely not even Librarians could withstand such punishment, but you're witnessing two fellers doing just that. You order the two to break up the fight.\nYou watch as the two men peculiarly shake hands and clap one another on the shoulder, each congratulating the other on how nasty their hand work was."

Men are crowded behind a burn barrel not far from the station platform, eagerly watching something in the distance. Squnting your vision, you notice one of your commanders and one of the newly hired Gopniks doing something odd. A tin can is perched atop the mans head. Whilst the other is taking gradual steps away, gun in his hand.\n\nAsking your right hand man what is going on, he explains that the two men are going to try some sort of stunt that involves shooting the can off from the mans head. Shocked, you exclaim thats not safe at all, to which the brother grins and explains that is the point."

Taking a seat amongst them as the commander gets ready to take the shot as the gopnik balances the tin can atop his head. When the tin is ready the commander draws back his handgun, narrowing his gaze as he gazes down the barrel. The rest of the brigands exchange bets and speculate wildly on whether or not he misses. Some averting their gaze only momentarily, but the spectacle is truly too much.\n\nA great gasp follows the sound of lead firing. Men reel back in their seats, wincing and gritting their teeth. The tin can erupts, and debris sprinkles across the floor. After the brief silence the crowd erupts into cheers which the commander hails, the lowly Gopnik slackens his posture and looks relieved."

random_event_military_bandit.3.d: "You mull the unfolding situation. Twice, thrice over. The Bratok all look towards you, expecting you to stop the unfolding situation, yet instead you decide to take a seat amongst them. This spurs a brief cheer amongst the crowd which quickly dies down to a hush whisper as the commander, and the Gopnik get ready.\n\n\n''Make sure to hit the can!'' One thug shouts. Laughter ripples and dies as quickly as it erupts. Laughter repeats again in nervous anticipation. The sound of lead discharging dispells the tense crowd into silence. Followed by an abrupt THUD as the bratok crumples into the floor."
