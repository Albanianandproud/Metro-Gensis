 nf_ULI.2.t: "Reports at Oktyabr'skoe Pole"
 nf_ULI.2.d: "Reports that the cordon at Polezhaevskaya have been breached have come to our attention! A detachment of over 100 soldiers, and armed militia of Begovaya have been sent to Polezhaevskaya, but what they discovered was even more insidious than what they could ever hope to imagine. The Majority of the citizens upon Polezhaevskaya Street are gone! No traces of people, no sign of blood or bullet casings or even a sign of a struggle! As if they have simply vanished."
 nf_ULI.2.a: "Blow the tunnels, abandon the North"

 nf_ULI.3.t: "Abandon the North"
 nf_ULI.3.d: "Scouts sent north to survey the remaining stretch of the  Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya have mysteriously been vanishing. Whilst the first group sent was believed to have simply deserted, and the orders raised to not go searching for them. It has come to our attention that it is more simply than individuals losing faith in the Confederation which is the reason for the circumstance of their disappearance.\nThis information is strictly classified and must be kept from the rest of the population in fear of causing mass panic. Whether the threat is human, animal or something else it is evidently clear that Polezhaevskaya may be at the mercy of the next freak paranormal disappearance. We may subtly try and «evacuate» the station to soften the impact. Or simply leave it to fate to decide."
 nf_ULI.3.a: "Strange things are happening"
 nf_ULI.3.a.tt: "The Two stations of §YPolezhaevskaya§! and §YOktyabr'skoe Pole§! will eventually become uninhabitable due to the amount of disappearances and paranormal activity.\nWe may decide to usher in a safe evacuation, without causing alarm to our population or try make a stand against whatever threat is lingering in the dark."

 nf_ULI.4.t: "Strike the Source"
 nf_ULI.4.d: "Soldiers have been sent across the perimeter defences. Three hundred meters and another three hundred meters beyond our soldiers moved. Their movements unabated until a thunderous tremor erupted across the tunnelway. Fearing a tunnel collapse, the soldiers rushed back into Polezhaevskaya where the population was thrown into a panic. As the population began to scatter and pile up attempting to flee the station the returning soldiers managed to organize the distraught crowds. Eventually managing to wreath back discipline amongst them."
 nf_ULI.4.a: "The Threat seems to have been neutralized, good job soldiers!"

 nf_ULI.5.t: "Factionalism in the Confederation"
 nf_ULI.5.d: "The Confederation is all but in name only. There once was indeed a Confederation, but now it has devolved into factionalism between each of the stations. Chiefly amongst them are the Indigos and Ants. Individualist and Collectivist sects respectively who share the majority of the silent power within the Confederation. Each station reigns with a certain amount of self-autonomy from one another. Ensuring that Disagreements may sometimes ultimately lead to the entire nation to be in a deadlock.\n\n Ants are self-collectivized based upon the principles of communism. Believing that their ultimate goal is to contribute in any possible way to the wellbeing of the station.\n\nIndigos however, are a clan of dissidents who united to resist the aggression of Antis. Each of the members have their own unique skills and believe that the grueling «busywork» is not for them."
 nf_ULI.5.a: "The Confederation must endure!"
 nf_ULI.5.a.tt: "If our £stability_icon §YStability§! drops below §Y20%§!, with one §YFaction§! having the upper hand, they will surely attempt revolt against the §YConfederation§!."

 nf_ULI.6.t: "Question of Leadership"
 nf_ULI.6.d: "The Confederation has been through a rocky number of years. Even more pressing are the current issues as it stands facing the Confederation in the near future. Many individuals as such doubt our current leader, and in turn clamour for a change in leadership. So much so that these concerns cannot be simply overlooked."
 nf_ULI.6.a: "Collectivization is our only Way"
 nf_ULI.6.b: "Individualism Above all Else"
 nf_ULI.6.c: "Zotov has Proven himself to be a capable leader"

 nf_ULI.10.t: "A Confederation beyond the Brink"
 nf_ULI.10.d: "The Confederation has reached a tipping point. Internal disputes threaten to rip the fabric of our union into two. Sides begin to draw their plans, and now attempt to topple our regime."
 nf_ULI.10.a: "The Confederation must stand"

 ## Semi Random Events
 nf_ULI.7.t: "Fuel Shortages"
 nf_ULI.7.d: "Citizens of Begovaya have recently been brought to our Administration attention to be withholding fuel reserves they had discovered from the rest of the population. Refusing outright to hand or even sell it to neighbouring stations of the Coalition, and instead sell it at double or triple the price to outsiders in turn to make a profit."
 nf_ULI.7.a: "They have a Right to sell the Fuel as they please"
 nf_ULI.7.b: "That Fuel belongs to everyone, especially the Confederation"

 nf_ULI.8.t: "Rumours Abound"
 nf_ULI.8.d: "The Citizens of Barrikadnaya enjoy a rather improved living standard compared to the rest of the citizens of the 1905 Confederation. Thanks due to their close proximity to the Rich Hanseatic League which borders a station crossing. However, rumours exist in the Confederation that the Hanseatic League are only trading openly with the citizens of Barrikadnaya in order to peacefully subvert and annex their station in the near future. Whether it is true, remains to be seen, however many amongst our Administration feel that the citizens of Barrikadnaya are discordant with the principles that the Confederation were founded upon."
 nf_ULI.8.a: "Clamp down on any suspicious activity"
 nf_ULI.8.b: "Its all just myths.."

 nf_ULI.9.t: "The Begovtsy Toll"
 nf_ULI.9.d: "Long ago did it come attention the two squabbling factions cant get along. However recent actions seems to make it pale in comparison. Residents of Begovaya are now demanding that other citizens have to pay a «toll» to pass through their territory. This toll in question can range wildly in price from unloading all a persons bullets, to forfeiting half of the goods they're seeking to transport."
 nf_ULI.9.a: "We must clamp down on this immediately"
 nf_ULI.9.b: "We should clamp down on it... unless.."
