 GWC_four_pillars_desc:0 "The Great Worm Cult has survived off of 4 main principles since the dawn of its creation. A permanent food supply is needed to sustain the starving population and keep them in our stations. Every group needs its members, and a large population can support our ambitions in the metro. Our great worm has given us this opportunity to live in the metro, and in order to repay him we must ensure that all members of the cult fully believe in the cult. Infamy will give us the opportunity to spread our religion in the metro, gaining us new members and abductees. As long as we can continue to get more food, obtain new members, grow faith and gain infamy, the cult will continue to thrive. But should any of these things falter within our stations, problems will begin to arise. \n \n§OFood: [?GWC_food]§! £faction_bul_bzns \n \n§YMembers: [?GWC_member]§! £text_infiltrate_army_token \n \n§RFaith: [?GWC_faith]§! £infinity_icon \n \n§gInfamy: [?GWC_fame]§! £legitimacy"
