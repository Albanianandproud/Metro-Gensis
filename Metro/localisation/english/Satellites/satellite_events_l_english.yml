 nf_satellite.0.t: "[prev.GetNameDef] plans to attack us!"
 nf_satellite.0.d: "Reports have come in from the border tunnels that [prev.GetNameDef] are quickly massing troops on our border. The pitiful mutant scum seem to be planning on launching a border skirmish against our territory. Let them come."
 nf_satellite.0.a: "We'll be ready to face them. Die muties!"

 nf_satellite.1.t:0 "Technical Talents"
 nf_satellite.1.d:0 "We should pool our talent together and prioritise one specific facet of our production lines. There is no point dividing them out between all different types of gizmos - we need to focus on the one thing which will be worthwhile in the future."
 nf_satellite.1.a:0 "We should focus on our Guns"
 nf_satellite.1.b:0 "Our Rail-Carts should be prioritised"
 nf_satellite.1.c:0 "Our Specialized Squad Equipment needs refitting"
 nf_satellite.1.e:0 "Special Forces should come first"

 nf_satellite.2.t:0 "Successful Border Skirmish!"
 nf_satellite.2.d:0 "After days of grueling fighting, our forces finally managed to gain an edge over the enemy forces. A triumphant show and display of our might over the enemy forces will surely make them reconsider their expansion."
 nf_satellite.2.a:0 "Great Success"

 nf_satellite.3.t:0 "Our Forces are Pushed Back!"
 nf_satellite.3.d:0 "After days of grueling fighting, our forces were unfortunately repelled by the enemy forces. It seems our efforts were not enough. The enemy, as much as we hate to admit it were too strong for our forces."
 nf_satellite.3.a:0 "Damn It!"

 nf_satellite.4.t:0 "Border Conflict - Stalemate"
 nf_satellite.4.d:0 ""
 nf_satellite.4.a:0 "Damn It"

 nf_satellite.5.t:0 "Help Sought Against The Fascist Menace!"
 nf_satellite.5.d:0 "With Fascists gearing to go on the warpath, neighbouring stations huddle close to their hermetic gates, shielding their arms close to their chests. Of course, the denizens of the Metro know that we, russians once fought and won against the Nazis many years ago - hopefully they know anyways. However if we are to expand across all of the Underground, perhaps we should assist these poor, destitute citizens in their defence?"
 nf_satellite.5.a:0 "We cannot afford to lend them our support"
 nf_satellite.5.b:0 "We can send them Support"
 nf_satellite.5.c:0 "Anyone who will stand against Fascism, is our friend"

 nf_satellite.6.t:0 "Redline Dismisses our Request"
 nf_satellite.6.d:0 "After careful contemplation, the Redline has dismissed our request with help against the Reich. It seems that they have forgotten their legacy as the victors against Nazism, or that are too craven to assist to our defence. We are alone in this struggle."
 nf_satellite.6.a:0 "They fed us to the Dogs!"

 nf_satellite.7.t:0 "Redline Sends their Support!"
 nf_satellite.7.d:0 "After careful contemplation, the Redline have sent us support against the Reich. A singular officer from the Redline who will oversee our forces and carefully train our commanding officers with tried and true tactics used to stall the Fascist menace. Despite the officers in question questionable tactics, and the theory that he is little more than a mere reject from the Redlines own pool of rather dubious army officers, our armed forces and populace are more than happy with the sentiment from the Redline. Although our soldiers present their dismay over the increase in drills and standard procedures implemented."
 nf_satellite.7.a:0 ""

 nf_satellite.8.t:0 "The Redline Sends Arms!"
 nf_satellite.8.d:0 "After careful contemplation, the Redline have sent us support in the form of weapons and equipment. On closer inspection they seem to be weathered and worn, most likely used in former fighting or rejected equipment to be recycled by Kuznetsky technicians. Regardless with extra supplies to go around our Armed forces no longer need to worry. We wont have to go into battle with spears and throwing rocks like the more wealthy Merchants would have you believe."
 nf_satellite.8.a:0 "Thanks, these will come in need"

 nf_satellite.9.t:0 "Altercation in [prev.GetNameDef] territory"
 nf_satellite.9.d:0 "Earlier today, we received reports that our merchants were seemingly harassed by the station guard in [prev.GetNameDef] and were forced to withdraw out from their territory. As tensions surmount between the Hanseatic League, and [prev.GetNameDef] it seems relations have soured. Undoubtedly so as this will only serve to further ruin relations between us."
 nf_satellite.9.a:0 "Damn Them!"

 nf_satellite.10.t:0 "Battle of Titans"
 nf_satellite.10.d:0 "The Redline have gone to war against the Hanseatic League, and so we must commit to our part of the deal... However..."
 nf_satellite.10.a:0 "We had a deal, to war!"
 nf_satellite.10.b:0 "Second thought, lets not."

 nf_satellite.11.t:0 "Battle of Titans"
 nf_satellite.11.d:0 "The Hanseatic have gone to war against the Redline, and so we must commit to our part of the deal... However..."
 nf_satellite.11.a:0 "We had a deal, to war!"
 nf_satellite.11.b:0 "Second thought, lets not."
