 nf_ARB.1.t:0 "An invitation to an Alliance with Europa"
 nf_ARB.1.d:0 "Europa proposes that we should ally with them due to the increasing threat of the Great Worm Cult. While we have our differences this may benefit us."
 nf_ARB.1.a:0 "For Now"
 nf_ARB.1.a:0 "Never!"
 
 nf_ARB.2.t:0 "Guarantees for Europa"
 nf_ARB.2.d:0 "Europa proposes that we should ally with them due to the increasing threa of the Great Worm Cult. While we have our differences this may benefit us."
 nf_ARB.2.a:0 "For Now"
 nf_ARB.2.a:0 "Never!"

 nf_ARB.3.t:0 "Economic addendum"
 nf_ARB.3.d:0 "During the Coalition war, communities were stripped bare of capable people. Engineers, Doctors, Electricians became Soldiers, Scouts, Medics. The hardest part of war comes when its over, having to pick up the pieces, check the survivors and rebuild with the scraps left. Trying to give to the people back a part of what they lost. Its going to take some serious elbow grease to get our shit together. We're sitting on pristine land, alot of landmarks topside still ripe for plucking. Since Stalkers come near and far to peddle every bit of scrap they pinch from from the surface. There are other destitute stations who could only dream to have the prospect that we have. Only issue is, what can we bring to the table? Baumansky has claimed the electronic share of the market, Kuznetsky Most is where you go to find a gun that doesn't corrode after 15 minutes of usage. A basic economics class aside, selling items found topside could easily help aleviate some prevailing issues with Arbats economy. Using the money to in-turn fund reconstruction efforts. A few pig stys here, a gunsmithing bench there. Arbat wont be some backwards station like those from Prospekt Mira would want you to believe."
 nf_ARB.3.a:0 "Hopefully this will increase our economic standing"

 nf_ARB.4.t:0 "We wont go quietly"
 nf_ARB.4.d:0 "This cannibal cult stomping in Park Pobedy has been discovered, and the military are quick to commence active military engagements to take them down. Already we have discovered a few secretive passages believed to have been used by the cult to sneak past our patrols unabated. No more will screams be heard from the pipes and collapsed tunnels leading to that part of the Metro."

 nf_ARB.5.t:0 "A good scavenging run"
 nf_ARB.5.d:0 "Its not everyday the Stalkers return with good news. Most often than not if they're elated to return its to warm themselves around the hearth, or to peddle off the liquor they've concealed at the bazaar. This is not one of those instances, however much rather the Stalkers have carried themselves back items which will very much help our community out"
 nf_ARB.5.a:0 "Various vials of high-grade chemicals"
 nf_ARB.5.b:0 "Some discarded weapon schematics"

 nf_ARB.6.t:0 "Promising Discovery"
 nf_ARB.6.d:0 "Our Stalker teams have returned with great news. A routine plundering job has discovered more than pieces of rebar and scrap to be used."
 nf_ARB.6.a:0 "Post-war Workplace manuals written on scraps of paper. Possibly from Baumansky? No... Far FAR too organized"
 nf_ARB.6.b:0 "An old CnC machine, those bastard guns aren't going to be bastards to use anymore eh?"

 nf_ARB.7.t:0 "Offering for Kievskaya"
 nf_ARB.7.d:0 "The Arbat Confederation has arrived with a proposition. They seek to purchase the station Kievskaya from our authority. In return for a permanent place in the Commonwealth. Relations between Hansa and Arbat has only grown within recent months, and the two share a special relationship dating to even before the Coalition wars."
 nf_ARB.7.a:0 "Its a deal"
 nf_ARB.7.b:0 "The stations of the Commonwealth are not a commodity to be bought and sold"
 nf_ARB.7.c:0 "We'll allow the purchase, but don't expect our traders to packup and move elsewhere"

 nf_ARB.8.t:0 "Kievskaya Secured"
 nf_ARB.8.d:0 "Despite the Commonwealth underhanding schemes and subtle manipulation; their administrators have come together to debate our offer, after talks they have agreed to the proposal. A brief window of time will allow the transfer of station personel from Kievskaya to return to Hansa, as the citizenry has been ensured the handover of leadership will be swift and seamless."
 nf_ARB.8.a:0 "A good day for the Arbat Confederation!"

 nf_ARB.9.t:0 "Offer turned down"
 nf_ARB.9.d:0 "Despite the Commonwealths underhanded schemes and subtle manipulation; their administrators have come together and after hours of debates and talkes they have turned down our proposal. Unwilling to go ahead with the offer. They retort that their stations are not commodities to be merely bought and sold, and despite the long-lasting relation between the Confederation and the Commonwealth, they do not see the benefit of the transation of station."
 nf_ARB.9.a:0 "It was a tempting offer, damn you"
 nf_ARB.9.b:0 "Kievskaya Belongs to us, whether peaceful handover or by force"

 nf_ARB.10.t:0 "Devastation"
 nf_ARB.10.d:0 "Whilst the ocassional disappearance can be written off as Citizens deciding to abruptly leave, on the behalf of our station authorities. This time it is something else entirely, more and more citizens have been going missing. No longer subtle dissappearances but now people left, right and center vanishing as if the metro gave out and swallowed them up whole leaving no trace. The citizenry are scared."
 nf_ARB.10.a:0 "Fear the dark"

 nf_ARB.11.t:0 "What of them?"
 nf_ARB.11.d:0 "Whilst many of their members fled deeper into belly of the Metro. Much of their flock still reign on Park Pobedy. Grizzly effigies, totem poles and cages hung from the walls of the station. Bodies and corpses littering the platforms from the battles. Many of their members were captured, scrawny and deformed. Gaunt pale figures no longer human. Question is, what do we do with them?"
 nf_ARB.11.a:0 "Shoot the adults. Perhaps we may recondition the children"
 nf_ARB.11.b:0 "Shoot them all. Leave not one of those freaks alive"

 nf_ARB.13.t:0 "An invitation to an Alliance with Arbat"
 nf_ARB.13.d:0 "Arbat proposes that we should ally with them. The two could develope close economic ties ad the relations could clearly be a boon to our station. While we have our differences this may benefit us."
 nf_ARB.13.a:0 "For Now"
 nf_ARB.13.a:0 "Never!"
