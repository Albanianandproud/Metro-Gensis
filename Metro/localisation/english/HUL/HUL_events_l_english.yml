  nf_HUL.1.t: "Trade with Anarchists..?"
  nf_HUL.1.d: "The [HUL.GetName] arrive to us, looking to trade. They usually like to sit about, discussing topics like universal solidarity, and other shit then actually putting it into effect. We should consider their proposal, perhaps it might benefit us."
  nf_HUL.1.a: "A good deal indeed"
  nf_HUL.1.b: "We dont have time for this"
  nf_HUL.2.t: "General Nestor...?"
  nf_HUL.2.d: "With the dust beginning to settle, and the enemy pushed far away from the Republic, people of our stations celebrate our hard-won victory. The Enemy has been vanquished, thanks to our leader, whos decisive leadership and hardened resolve rallied our forces in its most darkest hour. Praised by everyone, even the old grumblers amongst our comrades. With his charisma, and savvy knowledge, perhaps Uncle himself could lead our forces further beyond our domain.. perhaps across the Metro proper beneath the black and red flag? Not as conquerer.. but as liberators?"
  nf_HUL.2.a: "General Nestor.. Has a ring to it, doesn't it?"
  nf_HUL.2.b: "Nestor Would much rather sit, and allow someone else to take lead"
  nf_HUL.3.t: "Doped up Anarchy"
  nf_HUL.3.d: "What initially began as benign interests, or ways to stave off fatigue has cralwd into a widespread dependence. From the lowly rank and file milita, even to our commanders, everyone seems to be on some sort of drug. Substance abuse is rife, and addiction, dependency and all manners of erratic behaviour stifling to witness. We face a dilemma, crack down and risk our armed forces running into a halt. Or simply.. look the  other way."
  nf_HUL.3.a: "We must look the other way for now"
  nf_HUL.3.b: "We must crackdown on this at once!"
  nf_HUL.4.t: "Signs of Improvement"
  nf_HUL.4.a: "Good"
  nf_HUL.4.d: "Months after the high command initiated a full-scale crackdown on substance abuse within the armed forces, signs of recovery are beginning to show. Withdrawal cases and morale issues initially plagued the ranks, but with stricter oversight, counseling programs, and a return to discipline, units are regaining their cohesion.\n Squad Leaders report improved coordination, fewer breakdowns in the field, and a renewed sense of trust between command and the common soldier. While some still grumble about the new regulations, the worst appears to be behind us. We may have sacrificed short-term performance, but the militia now marches on steadier ground."

  nf_HUL.17.t: "Stalker Disappearances"
  nf_HUL.17.d: "By now it must be clear that our Stalkers are not doing well as they should. Either they have been cursed with bad luck, or are simply not up to the task at hand. Once on sorties, our Stalkers randomly disappear and do not make it back to [HUL.Capital.GetName]."
  nf_HUL.17.a: "Something Seems wrong."
  nf_HUL.18.t: "Watchers in the White"
  nf_HUL.18.d: "Its becoming clear that our Stalkers are intentionally being picked off by an unseen threat. What we thought at first were freak accidents, or the occassional Mutant now proves a more human culprit. The facists of Tverskaya don't tread this far, and the ideologically fanatic Stalkers of the Redline stick to the inner city, or anyplace of cultural significance."
  nf_HUL.18.a: "We must hold our Stalkers, we cannot afford losing them."
  nf_HUL.19.t: "A former foe resurfaces"
  nf_HUL.19.d: "As it turns out, we were correct. It wasn't facist stalkers, or communist ones picking our forces off but a different group entirely. They refer to them as the Aviators; former members of the Mikoyan Design Bureau who managed to survive the war remaining largely intact inside their dugout bunkers. They continue their research unintruded by nuclear armageddon. We fought them once, many years ago. They had set up a base of operations at [HUL.Capital.GetName], but we eventually drove them off. Ever since they have been recouperating, biding their time readying themselves to pounce and reestablish connection with the Metro once more.\nThe Rumours of them managing to create humanoid robotic soldiers were largely fabricated, but what they have managed to build and develop in that timeframce, we don't wish to find out."
  nf_HUL.19.a: "They can be beaten. We can defeat them again."
  nf_HUL.20.t: "All along the Watchtower"
  nf_HUL.20.d: "Mikoyan sorties become more aggressive week upon week. All the signs are obvious, they plan to make a breach into the Metro and strike our stations. We must be ready."
  nf_HUL.20.a: "Brace the watchposts, all hands on deck!"
  nf_HUL.21.t: "Addendum"
  nf_HUL.21.d: "It seems the forces sent by the Aviators have retreated for now, we can breath a sigh of relief now that we have matched the best of their forces. It will take a tremendous amount of time for them to conduct any harassment skirmishes against our forces, or our stalkers. We should now be able to safely send Stalkers to the surface without them being picked off by the Aviators."
  nf_HUL.21.a: "Good news at last."
  nf_HUL.22.t: "From here to the future."
  nf_HUL.22.d: "An uncertainty now has arisen in the aftermath of our fight with the Aviators, one thing remains clear. The Republic cannot stay idle, content with its corner of the Metro forever. What if the Aviators were instead Fascists? Capitalists looking to squash the last bastion of workers freedom, or the Redline ennacting revenge? History is written by those who write, but its the victors which get to write whatever they feel pleased to."
  nf_HUL.22.a: "A future for the Republic must be decided."

  nf_HUL.24.t: "Target of Slander by [HUL.GetName]"
  nf_HUL.24.d: "We have been the target of bad rumors by the [HUL.GetName]. Their newspapers have spread far across the metro, and word quickly spread to us. The news, even if completely erronious and false seems to have a wide ranging effect. Circulating rumours have scared off many merchants from coming to our doorstep."
  nf_HUL.24.a: "Stupid News"
  nf_HUL.24.b: "Close all access to this information at once!"
  nf_HUL.24.c: "Good thing nobody can read"
  nf_HUL.25.t: "Praised by [HUL.GetName]"
  nf_HUL.25.d: "Simple anarchists, bandits or thugs, now with the ability to write and produce newspapers. Thankfully we have not been the target of their sneering scrutiny, but infact appraisal. Writing about the steadily improving standards of our stations. Undoubtedly anyone who can read, will look to our stations in a more lighter tone."
  nf_HUL.25.a: "Thats good, at the very least"
  nf_HUL.25.b: "We do not need your empty words of praise"
  nf_HUL_aviators.0.t: "Research Above All Else"
  nf_HUL_aviators.0.d.a: "As Moscow lies in smouldering ruins, remnants of old world still lingers. Deep beneath walls of reinforced concrete and metal, the Mikoyan Bureau remains undeterred - scientists and engineers continue in their tireless work, driven by near maddening obsession. Their research now marches forward, without restraint or bereft of suggestion or morals. The apocalypse has not silenced curiosity - it has simply just refined it into something more colder, more resolute."
  nf_HUL_aviators.0.d.b: "With all their needs fufilled, The [AVV.GetName] can crack on with their operations, completing agendas and prototyping their research into fruition. They don't need anything from us, for now."
  nf_HUL_aviators.0.a: "We can surely spare the help if needed."
  nf_HUL_aviators.0.b: "We shall let them work undisturbed for now."
  HUL_AVV_improved_guns: "The §Y[AVV.GetName]§! Have improved their machinery, thanks to our help. §Y[?HUL_aviator_assistance_give_guns]§! Effects have been Improved."
  HUL_can_help_aviators_again: "We may assist §Y[AVV.GetName]§! with their research once again."

  HUL_aviator_cooldown: "The §Y[AVV.GetName]§! are busy with conducting research. No §Y[AVV.GetNameAdj]§! related Decisions can be taken for the time being."

  nf_HUL_aviators.1.t: "Post Mortem Progress"
  nf_HUL_aviators.1.d: "Thankless service aside, they are content with the delivery of Electronics for now. For what purpose? The Engineers dared not to answer our questions. 'You wouldn't understand' and other condescending words muttered beneath their strained breath. Whatever it is, our help is producing results. Impressive ones at the least.\nThe more Amiable engineers at the very least showed some thankfulness, even if their grins have grown more detached. In return, they've allowed us to see fit to peruse their stockpiles. Its nothing fancy, but the show of content goes along way considering we halved their numbers years before."
  nf_HUL_aviators.1.a: "We hope those electronics could be of use."
  HUL_aviator_can_purchase_firearms: "Unlocked Decision: §Y[?HUL_aviator_assistance_give_guns]§!. May purchase Guns from §Y[AVV.GetName]§!"

  nf_HUL_aviators.2.t: "Knowledge Yields"
  nf_HUL_aviators.2.d: "The lights in their bunkers flicker a little brighter, thanks to our efforts. The Bureau asked for energy to fuel their research, and we provided. Now their efforts can run both day and night at macht efficiency. Their models predict nothing but vast progress and now their expected timeframe has been slashed. The Engineers are hard at work they say, but they hardly will bother to tell us what exactly. There are whispers of experiments only those could dream of, things best left unknown. But they dare not let us in, it would only curb efficiency."
  nf_HUL_aviators.2.a: "Happy we could be of service"

  nf_HUL_aviators.3.t: "Atomic Enlightenment"
  nf_HUL_aviators.3.d: "No orders come, no contracts nor nations to command them. Engineering and Science unrestraint. Without morals, or without question. They mutter, but tell us plainly that this is for the goodness of humanity, once the equations have been finished. With simulations left to run, and analysis left to ponder. Because science must go on. The world may have ended years ago, but knowledge firmly rolls along.\n\nWhatever soppyness the eggheads give, some of them have offered for us to 'borrow' old electronics they have no use of. Sure, Computers and floppy drives built before the turn of the 21st century could easily be broken into parts, they're awfully inclining us to put it to 'better use'. Whatever that means."
  nf_HUL_aviators.3.a: "We certainly can be of further assistance."

  nf_HUL_aviators.4.t: "Pursuit of Progress"
  nf_HUL_aviators.4.d: "They tell us they're close. Closer than ever. Even their predictions didn't forsee them to come this far. Behind their masked request holds a budding excitement. Everything for them is converging, all the years of fruitless scientific endeavours, setbacks and calamities. The final variables need be aligned. Speculation has evolved into theory and is almost to becoming a reality. They need help with this.\n\nFinally, they have agreed to tell us about their research. Its no mystery that when we were attacked by their forces years ago, they were aided by machines. While they were simple drones, fabricated from pre-existing bomb-defusal machines they had pilfered years before, their failed attack had launched them back to square one and to the drawing board. Much more of a opportunity than a curse as they initially thought. Instead of machine droids, they could create wholly autonomous units, capable of commucation, reconnisance and to think and make decisions on its own. Self-awareness, without the intrusive considerations sentience arrives with it. There is no knowing what good this could have not only to us, but the future of Humanity. AI which serves human needs, and serves values, not directed by capitalist or imperialist fingers.\n\nBut the Bureau is running strained. Personel are reaching their threshold, they require more. More of everything. Margins, are increasingly narrowing and the stakes now are inconcievable.\nThey Assure us it will be worth everything. All we must do, is push a little further.."
  nf_HUL_aviators.4.a: "We will assist them. This better be worth it."
  HUL_aviator_final_decision_tooltip: "We must help the §Y[AVV.GetName]§! one last time. They require more energy, and more resources for the final stretch.. Perhaps this so called §Y[106.GetName]§! Might contain what we need...?"

  nf_HUL_aviators.5.t: "Thought from Steel"
  nf_HUL_aviators.5.d: "Its alive. Well.. kind of. They have unveiled the first prototype batch of robots. They stumble more than they can walk upright, their aim is imperfect compared to our veteran forces, and their response time is significantly delayed. It cannot think like we can, but it doesn't need to. It follows and obeys, and kills.\n\nThe prototypes are crude, more machine and cogs than actual intelligence, and more robotic and humanoid in design. But it operates without sleep, without food or without restraint. The first batch isn't simply a method of war, its a blueprint to a future."
  nf_HUL_aviators.5.a: "The threshold has been crossed. The Revolution Now calls us."
  HUL_aviators_can_produce_combat_robots_tt: "Unlocked Decision: §Y[?HUL_aviator_assistance_produce_combat_ai]§! May request aditional combat machines from §Y[AVV.GetName]§!."
