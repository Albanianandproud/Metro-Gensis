  LEP_disease_legacy: "[?YAS_plague_legacy]"
  LEP_disease_legacy_desc: "Narrowly avoiding absolute calamity following an infectious outbreak at §YNovoyasenevskaya§! by fiercely refusing to share its medicine with the neighbouring infected stations, the station is currently reeling from economic turmoil. Perhaps, a divine act of punishment for the stations selfishness."
  LEP_mutant_population: "Mutant Tolerance"
  LEP_mutant_population_desc: "Because of its close proximity to the surface, and the fact the station was only partially finished when the bombs dropped, §YLesoparkovaya§! holds an unusally high percentage of residents with mutated abnormalities. A strict curfew has been installed, restricting relations between humans and mutants to stem their numbers and to recouperate what little positive rekation with their neighbours they have left."
