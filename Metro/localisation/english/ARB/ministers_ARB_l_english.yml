 ARB_semyonovich:0 "Arkadiy Semenovich"
 ARB_SEMYONOVICH_DESC:0 "The current station chief of Kievskaya, a shaven, neat man despite the onset of old age. Once serving in the Army many years ago now finding himself overseeing the day-by-day activities required to keep his community in working order.\n\nIts known by a handful of people that Semenovich has a fondness of liquor. The expensive variety. Belief has it that he will pay good bullets for pristine wine, and not the cheap tat the Stalkers routinely stagger back from topside."

 ARB_arman:0 "Arman"
 ARB_ARMAN_DESC:0 "A tradesman of Armenian Descent. Arman is a stern figure with a constant focused stare slapped onto his face. He had found his living making money from selling off numerous wares found topside. Employing Stalkers to take to the surface in search of otherwise irrelavant objects he could sell at a exorbitant prices. Many venturers would otherside moan and grumble at the bequest of picking and combing piles of rubble in search for basic wares. Not particularly easy, fufilling or exciting work. But the pay covers the expenses. Despite his affluence, Arman prefers an altruist livestyle. His home is typical to others in the community and he much prefers to help where it is needed than to sit on his ivory tower and hoard his money. Although his benevolence tends to steer more towards other Caucasians alike rather than Russians."

 ARB_khandukht:0 "Khandukht"
 ARB_KHANDUKHT_DESC:0 "A woman of Armenian descent. She lived like many in the Arbat Confederation; day to day. Most people didn't care about war, only that their lives were torn apart. Nothing was the same as it used to be. Despite the situation humanity found itself in, life goes on, so it did for Khandukht, marrying a former veteran of the war and the two raised a child. Her life would come crashing down, following her husband killed in his living quaters, and their son subsequently snatched. Instead of admitting defeat, and driven by sheer will she pulled all her belongings together and sold them off to afford enough gear and ammunition to take up stalking as a profession. Clicking up with a group of stalkers who at first looked down towards her due to her gender. She soon found her footing in the profession and proved to be more resourceful and daring as much as her male counterparts. Determined to eventually seek some semblance of closure to her grief.
