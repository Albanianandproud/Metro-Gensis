 SAV_focus_consolidation_2: "Establish Law in Tsvetnoy Boulevard"

Formal authorities range from pimps, to whoever has accured enough IOUs from the eternally indebted population.

 SAV_focus_saint_nor_sinner_left_desc: "After the disappearance of more than a dozen of our folk, a storm of anger has been whipped all across the Alliance.
