 nf_RCH.1.t:0 "Mutant Labour"
 nf_RCH.1.d:0 "For Many mutants the Reich capture the sweet embrace of death is not enough. We can put them to work doing our bidding. As manpower must be siphoned off to our military force, there may be such usage for these vile freaks..."

 nf_RCH.6:0 "Fascist Incursion"
 nf_RCH.6.t:0 "Fascists at the Gate"
 nf_RCH.6.d:0 "We have more than just the Nosalis and Watchmen pouring in from the surface to contend with. Recent reports indicate that a mounting offense by Reich Stalkers are approaching with our station in their sights. Any adequate preparations will be made null as they are already closing in on our station. We have to stand firm, or we may find some common ground. A laughable offer to any, but our position is not a good one to be standing in."
 
 nf_RCH.6.a:0 "Despite best efforts, our forces were unmatched!"
 nf_RCH.6.b:0 "Somehow, for whatever reason, the Hole showed hospitality to the Stalkers, who were grateful"
 nf_RCH.6.c:0 "The Reich Hit-teams, with pure grit and determination, were fought off by our militia"

 nf_RCH.7.t:0 "Caravan from Venice"
 nf_RCH.7.d:0 "The Reich are aloof to outsiders, especially those of the Mutant variety which there are plenty of. Venice, however  have proven to be useful idiots in our plight. They offer us much needed resources and in return seek to learn some of our military knowledge. I doubt mutant scum will know how to fire a rifle, let alone keep one properly clean."
 nf_RCH.7.a:0 "These goods will support the Russisches volk "

 nf_RCH.9.c:0 "The Reich will have no such foul taint amongst its ranks"

 nf_RCH.10.t:0 "The Dregs of Mayakovskaya"
 nf_RCH.10.d:0 "Mayakovskaya Station is not far from the mother stations of the Reich. Whilst Hanseatic trade caravans routinely pass through the station, the Reich knows very little about the goings on in the station itself. We know however, there is a small population living at the station. Dregs, refuse from even the other nearby stations, who deem them to be the lowest of the low. Prime target for colonization!"
 nf_RCH.10.a:0 "The station was infested with degenerate humans. Quick! To Arms!"
 nf_RCH.10.b:0 "By the time our Soldiers entered the station, it was already empty."

 nf_RCH.11.t:0 "Outcasts"
 nf_RCH.11.d:0 "With our authority inside the Reich maintained now is the time to project our power outwards. All around us lies enemies; Mutants, bandits and worse... communists. However some worthwhile allies do remain; or rather useful to our cause for some time. One such is Stortbeker, and his rag-tag militia. Exiled from the confines of the Reich many years ago for his recklessness and extreme sadism. In that time between his exile and now he has coddled his own loyal group of other exiles or fanatics. Even some officials amongst the Reich affirm that Stortbeker even recruits mutants, although none dare to utter this claim outright in front of the Fuhrer.\nDespite this, Stortbeker is known to be a capable commander and a cunning leader who is ardently loyal to the Fuhrer, even before he managed to take power over the reich. We know that, despite his eviction from the Reich several years ago that he regularly stalks the southern metro tunnels along with his band of misfits preying upon mutant caravans and thwarting communist activities. Question is, are we willing to let him join back amongst our ranks?"
 nf_RCH.11.a:0 "Stortbeker, despite his obscene standards, still has his uses."
 nf_RCH.11.b:0 "Rumours true or not, he was exiled and should remain so"
 
 nf_RCH.12.t: "Stortbeker"
 nf_RCH.12.d: "Despite being denied to re-enter the Reich, Stortebeker has decided to establish his own territory in the south. He has disavowed the Reich, and our current reigning fuhrer, and claims he and his misfits are the true upholders of Fascism. Our propaganda ministry were quick to keep his agitators from spreading disinformation amongst our citizenry."
 nf_RCH.12.a: "That rat. He'll get whats coming to him!"
 nf_RCH.12.b: "The Rule from Tverskaya has come to an end."

 nf_RCH.15.t:0 "Absolute Authority - Addendum"
 nf_RCH.15.d:0 "Hail mein Fuhrer! Your position has now been cemented and your commitment to the Reich undisputed amongst the heer, it is now time to start planning our inevitable proliferation across the Metro! Your cause amongst the volk of the Reich must be strengthened however; all facets of society must be amalgamated as one if we are to rid the Underground of the freaks! With our economy, military and society geared into one ironed-fist will our military be able to tread far and wide from the Northern reaches of Altuf'yevo to the chained demesne of the Redline.\n\nHowever, we must plan our expansion with certainty. The indolent Hanseatic League may watch our efforts with hesitation to intervene but we cannot be certain they will keep their capitalist fingers out from our plans. That does not also take into consideration the Degenerates of the Redline, who will make every attempt to thwart our volk out.\n\nWe are the last group of pure humans in the entire world. Where our forefathers failed to ensure a future for our Volk, we cannot let this opportunity slip by. The Reich shall prosper under your watch, or not prosper at all. I trust you will lead us well, fuhrer."
 nf_RCH.15.a:0 "Hail Reich!"

 nf_RCH.20.t: "The Hows of Productions"
 nf_RCH.20.d: "Our efforts to further develop our weapons systems has been fruitful but we currently face a road block. Our lead machinist have become split between two camps with opposing ideas. One camp argues we must focus on pure increase production of weapons by any means to prevent our men from running out bullets for the limitless number of mutants we face. The other camp argues we must focus on refining our arms into greater weapons of killing, so every bullet is certain to to hit and kill, these improvements could pay for themselves in the long run. Both camps are evenly sized so this roadblock will last sometime unless we step in and make a decision. What are your orders?"
 nf_RCH.20.a: "Increase Quantity of Arms."

 nf_RCH.21.t: "Anti-Communist Pact"
 nf_RCH.21.d: "The Reich comes to us seeking another ally to stand against the festering rot of the Redline. Only together, united as one anti-bolshevik force shall the metro bve ridden of the red menace. If we accept, we shall cooperate closely with the Reich, and share intelligence upon the Communist menace.
 nf_RCH.21.a: "Accept"
 nf_RCH_21.b: "Refuse"

 nf_RCH.22.t: "Concessions to outsiders"
 nf_RCH.22.d: "The Reich sends envoys to us. The Metro is for the Russians! clean up the mutant filth they proclaim. While their genocidal rhetoric against the non-slavs and ethnic people has been relaxed in recent times. It remains to be seen whether or not they'll stick to their cause. Regardless, the Reich seeks to open its internal spheres, no longer a hermetic state surrounded by enemies like a cornered rat."

 nf_RCH.22.b: "Once a Fascist,  always a Fascist"

 nf_RCH.23.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] offers a trading partnership"
 nf_RCH.23.d: "The Reich, a hermetic state in the middle of the Metro has always closed its doors to outsiders. However they have come to us proposing a trade deal, in return for food and resources they will purchase wares from us. Reasonable proposition, no?"
 nf_RCH.23.a: "We both stand to gain from this"
 nf_RCH.23.b: "We do not deal with Fascists"

 nf_RCH.24.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] accepted our trading proposition"
 nf_RCH.24.d: "After careful consideration, the Hanseatic league has accepted our trade proposal."
 nf_RCH.24.a: "Great"

 nf_RCH.25.t: "Hanza refuses our trade request"
 nf_RCH.25.d: "After consideration, the Hanza has denied our request for trade access. It seems that we are not a worth trade partner to the Hanseatic League."
 nf_RCH.25.a: "Very well. They shall pay in time"

 nf_RCH.26.t: "The process of denazification failed"
 nf_RCH.26.d: "The SS units have responded to our series of changes to denazify our nation. As they stop carts and people from leaving the stations using force, the whole reich is getting to a halt, rage and turmoil. Our goals have blown up and the reich's authority is questioned by his own military."
 nf_RCH.26.a: "The Great Reich is falling apart..."

 nf_RCH.27.t: "Tolerance of the Non-Slavs"
 nf_RCH.27.d: "Now that we are slowly opening up the Reich, the question of non-slavs remain. Few within the upper circle of government wish to truly permit the swarthy races within the Reich, but even few still wish to commit to their outright extermination. Many stations are minority enclaves, and seeking to rid those territories  of their population is nigh impossible, nor is it a factor we would like to achieve."
 nf_RCH.27.a: "Non-Slavs deserve no place in the Reich"
 nf_RCH.27.b: "We can «tolerate» their kind for now"

 nf_RCH.28.t: "Blood on the Reich"
 nf_RCH.28.d: "What were you thinking? Allying with the disgusting mutants has only caused the Reich to rebel against you. They spit and curse your name, declaring you no better than the Mutant themselves!"
 nf_RCH.28.a: "My reasonings are beyond your comprehension."

 nf_RCH.29.t: "The Mutant prevails..?"
 nf_RCH.29.d: "Defeat draws near, our population grow tired of the war and our defeat shakes the very core of our ideology. The faith of our command structure in the fuhrer lay in tatters."
 nf_RCH.29.a: "Our Arrogance is our undoing"

 nf_RCH.30.t: "The Reich Stirs"
 nf_RCH.30.d: "Mutants are not the only threat lingering from the tunnels it seems. Our fascist neighbours in Tverskaya grow emboldened day by day. Engorged into fanaticism by the rhetoric of their Fuhrer, it seems they are no longer content with sitting idly in their Fortress-Station, but seek to expand outwards - the need for Lebensraum, or «living space» they call it, and our stations fall beneath their envious eyes."
 nf_RCH.30.a: "If a Fascist bleeds, then a fascist can die"

 nf_RCH_terror_campaign.1.t: "Campaigns of Terror"
 nf_RCH_terror_campaign.1.d: "It is time to clean our population of the sickly and abnormal. We must be pure of genetic taint and the failed experiments of mother nature. If Reich is to be free and eventually claim the earth, we must focus on the survival of our pure-bloods. Doctors shall examine each and every one of our citizens, nobody is exempt..."

 nf_RCH_terror_campaign.4.b: "Certain.. Exemptions can be produced in this instance"

 nf_RCH_fuhrer.1.t: "The Cult of Personality"
 nf_RCH_fuhrer.1.d: "The people look up to The Great Fuhrer of The Reich. Rows and rows of officers, generals, soldiers and citizens all stand and act as you order. The Fuhrer is now more than just a person, it is an icon. One that must be kept together and honed. You have built up a persona of fascism, mutant purges and the goal of defeating the communist threat. Turning your back and considering your morals now would be late and dangerous."
 nf_RCH_fuhrer.1.a: "Praise me and love me! I am your Fuhrer and I shall bring our people to the skies!"
 nf_RCH_fuhrer.1.a.tt: "Your leadership is assured, but we must not become too complacent. Many factions exist inside the Reich, each with their own goals and wishes.. but all seek the destruction of vile communists and fetid mutants. It would be wise to carefully tread, and ensure all parties remain content with your reign."

 nf_RCH_fuhrer.2.t: "Jubilations"
 nf_RCH_fuhrer.2.d: "Great news is brought to the citizens of the Reich today. The Report of you wifes pregnancy has been announced publicly, with many congratulating you and your wife and for good health. The Reich wishes for your newborn child to be a strong, healthy one. One that will eventually grow up and live in a beautiful, peaceful era."

 nf_RCH_fuhrer.3.t: "Wife Expects"
 nf_RCH_fuhrer.3.d: "Your wife goes into labour and gives birth to your own blood... but his head is strangely shaped and it seems he has trouble breathing for now. The doctors are afraid to give you the news but eventually they honestly call your son a mutant. The information is currently concealed, only the most trusty of the fuhrers inner circle know. How should we proceed with this information?"
 RCH_you_monster: "..§RYou monster§!"
 nf_RCH_fuhrer.3.a: "This is my son... No one must know about his true nature. Even if people will spread rumours"
 nf_RCH_fuhrer.3.b: "This is not my child. It is a beast"

 nf_RCH_fuhrer.4.t: "Chains of Command"
 nf_RCH_fuhrer.4.d: "With both the SS, and Metromacht now resolving their differences and no longer struggling to maintain supremacy over eachother we must not allow for such chance to happen again. The Fuhrer has the choice to indirectly favour one faction or the other. Whilst not openly admitting it, securing the loyalty of either side would do well, not only in legitimizing the fuhrers undisputed power through all chains of command, but keeping the eye on them. "
 nf_RCH_fuhrer.4.a: "The Gestapo can be trusted"
 nf_RCH_fuhrer.4.b: "The Metromacht are steadfast and faithful"

 nf_RCH_disgruntlement.1.t: "Blood on the Reich"
 nf_RCH_disgruntlement.1.d: "Growing concern over the actions of the Fuhrer have recently come to our attention. Whilst the internal factions of the Reich swear fealty, and would never dare to go against him its clear that his recent actions has sparked growing resentment towards the trajectory the Reich is heading.\n\nThe situation may grow more tenuous as time progresses. Divided a house falls, and we cannot allow the degenerate subhumans to take advantage of our position."
 nf_RCH_disgruntlement.1.a: "The Gestapo always seem to have a chip on their shoulder"
 nf_RCH_disgruntlement.1.b: "The Soldiers of the Reich are better than to doubt the Fuhrer"
