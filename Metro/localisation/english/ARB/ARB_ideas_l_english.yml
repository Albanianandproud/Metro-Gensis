  arbat: "Arbat Confederation"
  arbat_desc: "The Arbat Confederation is a Moderately-Capitalist community. Inhabited both by Russian and Caucasian nationalities. Whilst once upon a time, the community wielded substantial power and population. Diminished from receiving the short-end of the stick during the Hanza-Red Line war.
