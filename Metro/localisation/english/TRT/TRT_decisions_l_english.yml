As snow and ice accumilates during the winter months, and thus thaws during the summer sesaon, the water pours into the tunnels below. Flooding our stations even more every season.\n\n\nWe may prepare extensive measures and brace for further flooding, but we will ultimately be at the mercy of the seasons until we can either navigate the bulk of water to someplace else. Or fix the tunnel infrastructure.\n\n  Predicted Severity: [?Root.TRT_preparedness_requirement|H0]                                                           Current Preparedness:  [?TRT_preparedness|H0]\n"
