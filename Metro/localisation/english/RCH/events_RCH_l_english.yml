 nf_RCH.1:0 "Stalags of the Reich"
 nf_RCH.1.t:0 "Mutant Labour"
 nf_RCH.1.d:0 "For Many mutants the Reich capture the sweet embrace of death is not enough. We can put them to work doing our bidding. As manpower must be siphoned off to our military force, there may be such usage for these vile freaks..."

 nf_RCH.6:0 "Fascist Incursion"
 nf_RCH.6.t:0 "Fascists at the Gate"
 nf_RCH.6.d:0 "We have more than just the Nosalis and Watchmen pouring in from the surface to contend with. Recent reports indicate that a mounting offense by Reich Stalkers are approaching with our station in their sights. Any adequate preparations will be made null as they are already closing in on our station. We have to stand firm, or we may find some common ground. A laughable offer to any, but our position is not a good one to be standing in."
 nf_RCH.6.a:0 "Despite best efforts, our forces were unmatched!"#

 nf_RCH.7.t:0 "Caravan from Venice"
 nf_RCH.7.d:0 "The Reich are aloof to outsiders, especially those of the Mutant variety which there are plenty of. Venice, however  have proven to be useful idiots in our plight. They offer us much needed resources and in return seek to learn some of our military knowledge. I doubt mutant scum will know how to fire a rifle, let alone keep one properly clean."
 nf_RCH.7.a:0 "These goods will support the Russisches volk "

 nf_RCH.10.t:0 "The Dregs of Mayakovskaya"
 nf_RCH.10.d:0 "Mayakovskaya Station is not far from the mother stations of the Reich. Whilst Hanseatic trade caravans routinely pass through the station, the Reich knows very little about the goings on in the station itself. We know however, there is a small population living at the station. Dregs, refuse from even the other nearby stations, who deem them to be the lowest of the low. Prime target for colonization!"
 nf_RCH.10.a:0 "The station was infested with degenerate humans. Quick! To Arms!"
 nf_RCH.10.b:0 "By the time our Soldiers entered the station, it was already empty."

 nf_RCH.11.t:0 "Outcasts"
 nf_RCH.11.d:0 "With our authority inside the Reich maintained now is the time to project our power outwards. All around us lies enemies; Mutants, bandits and worse... communists. However some worthwhile allies do remain; or rather useful to our cause for some time. One such is Stortbeker, and his rag-tag militia. Exiled from the confines of the Reich many years ago for his recknlessness and extreme sadism. In that time between his exile and now he has coddled his own loyal group of other exiles or fanatics. Even some officials amongst the Reich affirm that Stortbeker even recruits mutants, although none dare to utter this claim outright infront of the Fuhrer.\nDespite this, Stortbeker is known to be a capable commander and a cunning leader who is ardently loyal to the Fuhrer, even before he managed to take power over the reich. We know that, despite his eviction from the Reich several years ago that he regularly stalks the southern metro tunnels along with his band of misfits preying upon mutant caravans and thwarting communist acitivites. Question is, are we willing to let him join back amongst our ranks?"
 nf_RCH.11.a:0 "Stortbeker, despite his obscene standards, still has his uses."
 nf_RCH.11.b:0 "Rumours true or not, he was exiled and should remain so"

 nf_RCH.13.t:0 "The Coup Attempt"
 nf_RCH.13.d:0 "Kreipp and his advisors would be seated in a secluded meeting room, discussing the next move to make. The best part? The cult barely had to do anything, the reich and fuhrer unravelled themselves. §RThe fuhrer lies dead...§!"
 nf_RCH.13.a:0 "Long live The Fuhrer 'Kreipp'!"

 nf_RCH.14.t:0 "The Coup Attempt"
 nf_RCH.14.d:0 "We've been unsuccessful in trying to launch a coup against the fuhrer, and it is too late for any other measures. All known cultists are being rounded up and shot on the spot. Kreipp lies dead in a ditch, his body being burned beyond recognition."
 nf_RCH.14.a:0 "We've failed..."

 nf_RCH.15.t:0 "Absolute Authority - Addendum"
 nf_RCH.15.d:0 "Hail mein Fuhrer! Your position has now been cemented and your committment to the Reich undisputed amongst the heer, it is now time to start planning our innevitable proliferation across the Metro! Your cause amongst the volk of the Reykh must be strengthened however; all facets of society must be amalgamated as one if we are to rid the Underground of the freaks! With our economy, military and society geared into one ironed-fist will our military be able to tread far and wide from the Northern reaches of Altuf'yevo to the chained demesne of the Redline.\n\nHowever, we must plan our expansion with certainty. The indolent Hanseatic League may watch our efforts with hesitation to intervene but we cannot be certain they will keep their capitalist fingers out from our plans. That does not also take into consideration the Degenerates of the Redline, who will make every attempt to thwart our volk out.\n\nWe are the last group of pure humans in the entire world. Where our forefathers failed to ensure a future for our Volk, we cannot let this opportunity slip by. The Reich shall prosper under your watch, or not prosper at all. I trust you will lead us well, fuhrer."
 nf_RCH.15.a:0 "Hail Reykh!"

 RCH_tutorial_1_tt: "\nIf we are to expand, we require the upmost support of our People. Our §YWar Support§! needs to be §Y100%§!, unwavering amongst the Volk!"
