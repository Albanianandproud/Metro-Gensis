  BRK_defensive_armored_brigades: "Drasine Fleets"
  BRK_defensive_armored_brigades_desc: "Apparently the Hanza has started using mobile brigades to ferry troops between stations. No, this is true infact. Ofcourse we sit in a position where no major would dare risk attacking us, but the same sentiment cannot be said for Bandits or Mutants. Our military force is small, but can be easily mitigated with the grace of mobilty. There is rumoured to be an old tram depot somewhere on the edge of our border. Perhaps we should crack it open, and take a look?"

  BRK_crush_republic: "Crush the Anarchists"
  BRK_crush_republic_desc: "You can never trust them, igor tells us. Nothing more than bandits and thugs with some idealized notion of solidarity towards the workers.

  BRK_pig_farms: "Pig Farms"
  BRK_pig_farms_desc: "One of the main staple sources of protein in the metro. Pigs can be used for a wide range and variety of usages; its hide into skin, its fat into soap.

  BRK_annex_trade_outpost_desc: "Belorusskaya remains an independent station between us and the Hanseatic League.
