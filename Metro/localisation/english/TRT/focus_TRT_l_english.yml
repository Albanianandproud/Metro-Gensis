 TRT_big_happenings_in_little_venice:0 "Big happenings in Little Venice"
 TRT_big_happenings_in_little_venice_desc:0 "Venice sits on a island surrounded by dark waters. A haven for scumbags and a refuge for crime, but many consider it a haven and their home. Juxtaposed by organized crime and folks just looking to get by, both groups gridlocked in an eternal struggle. Small scuffles here and there, but outright hostilities have not sparked... yet."

 TRT_city_on_stilts:0 "The Community on Stilts"
 TRT_city_on_stilts_desc:0 "Named after the old Italian city of Venice, once a powerful city-state during the time of Knights and Kingdoms. The station was flooded shortly after the war, and a great settlement was constructed on stilts floating above the murky depths. A dark subterrenean refuge not just for bandits nor thieves. But for wayward muscovites."

 TRT_house_that_dirt_built:0 "House that Dirt Built"
 TRT_house_that_dirt_built_desc:0 "Ramshackle foundations, rotting timber frames and an even more decrepit planning has given rise to the citys shoddy appearance. Tearing down half the city would just make the other half lunge at our administrations throats. We'll need a better, proper solution to fix the failing infrastructure. Thankfully, during winter months the water levels drop. Possibly a chance to establish more proper support frames?"

 TRT_flooding_protection:0 "Flooding Protection"
 TRT_flooding_protection_desc:0 "The biggest issue, is where the hell do we direct all this water? Thankfully however, passing traders have insisted on selling us a bunch of old water pump. Where the hell they got them from is anybodies guess."

 TRT_logistic_canals:0 "Logistic Canals"
 TRT_logistic_canals_desc:0 "Whilst the flooding creates numerous problems. Radiation, Mutants, washing Igors belongings last spring, it does posses strong economic opportunities. Water rafts and canoes can easily ship back and forth on the waters."

 TRT_increase_minimum_prepardness_10:0 "\nIncrease Our §YStarting Prepardness§! by §R10§!\nOur §YMinimum Prepardness§! equals: [?TRT_minimum_prepardness|H0].\n\n"

 TRT_shipping_routes:0 "Shipping Lanes"
 TRT_shipping_routes_desc:0 "With better rafts, come more goods to transport. More quantities of goods? More to sell, meaning more bullets to invest back into protecting our caravans from mutants. It isn't hard to understand, Slobodan."

 TRT_modular_districts:0 "Stockades"
 TRT_modular_districts_desc:0 "Sure, mutants are a pain to deal with. Radiation too to to think of it, and the threat of rogue waves or freak thaws is another matter entirey. But the biggest problem? Other bandits looking to muscle into our operations. Disgruntled shipmate giving up the details to rival bandits, or rowing head-first into a Hansa patrol. Not to mention one of them Spartans waltzing head first into one of our dens."

 TRT_public_works:0 "Public Canals"
 TRT_public_works_desc:0 "Venice wasn't sprung on the map from affluent merchants, ideological fanatic nut-jobs or snobbish wimps, it was built by the community. Folks who had nowhere else to go. Through spit and elbow grease and a whole lotta lead. Passage between stations should be justifiably owned by the community."

 TRT_toil_the_toll:0 "Toil the Toll"
 TRT_toil_the_toll_desc:0 "Think 'bout it. Tax people for coming and going through. These waterways are a cash-cow ripe for milking."

 TRT_venitian_determination:0 "Venetian Determination"
 TRT_venitian_determination_desc:0 "Bandit Triangle, or Venice. Whatever catches your drift its known that the people who live there are hardy, but know how to live life."


 TRT_what_lurks_beneath:0 "What Lurks Beneath"
 TRT_what_lurks_beneath_desc:0 "Mutant shrimps come and go following the thawing season. Disrupting travel, their presence making water navigation treacharous. We're going to have to deal with these infestations eventually. We can cull their excess numbers only for so long, until we run out of fuel or explosives. We must strike at the heart of the issue. Taking out their nests."

 TRT_depth_charges:0 "Depth Charges"
 TRT_depth_charges_desc:0 "Igor, our stockpile quatermaster and part-time barfly has come up with a ideal solution. Makeshift Depth Charges. Sure its nothing which could sink anything bigger than a rowboat. But mutants? It'll rip them into twain. Now- Just gotta draw straws and see which unlucky bastard is going to swim out there and lay these explosives..."

 TRT_cleansing_nests:0 "Cleaning Duty"
 TRT_cleansing_nests_desc:0 "Many of the Shrimp come from the surface, from murky bodies of water and sunken metro lines. Stalkers who travel from topside usually encounter such spawns. Their sporadic nesting patterns,the shrimp that is, makes culling difficult. But as long as we can keep their numbers properly in check. We won't have any issue."

 TRT_hardcore_fishing:0 "Hardcore Fishing"
 TRT_hardcore_fishing_desc:0 "You ever tried fishing with explosive bait? No? You should try it."

 TRT_kabloooeyyy:0 "Kabloooeyy!!"
 TRT_babloooeyyy_desc:0 "Who would've thought explosives would leave craters? Our Demolition activities have recently unearthed a large fissure leading deep within the earth, the hole is dry; and clear from water but flooding will eventually fill up the hole. But Gennady swears he saw something stirring down in the hole."

 TRT_draining_depths:0 "Dredging the Depths"
 TRT_draining_depths_desc:0 "You'd be surprised the amount of trash and other shit people just throw away into the water. Whilst a quick and relatively clean way to get rid of refuse, it has the nasty habit of settling on the river floor. Overtime piling up with junk and debris. You see where this is going...? We're gonna have to clean up the shit from the floor."
 TRT_able_to_use_decision_manpower:0 "Activate Decision Option: §YDredge Waterways of Debris§!"
 TRT_flooding_decision_resources:0 "\nWith every Defended flood, there is a chance for §YResources§! to be washed up."

 TRT_fish_industry:0 "Exploit the Waves"
 TRT_fish_industry_desc:0 "Underground chasms and reservoirs aren't only hiding mutants, but infact also plenty of fish infact. Some more mutated than others, but healthy enough to be eaten. With the looming infestations being dealt with... Whos hungry for Kulebyaka?"


 TRT_a_sport:0 "Like a fish in a barrel"
 TRT_a_sport_desc:0 "The more radioactive fish are inedible, but could be used as good target practise by our merchant fishermen."

 TRT_sustinance:0 "Fish Canning"
 TRT_sustinance_desc:0 "Eugene, one of our fishers thinks we could try canning our fish to stop it from spoiling by using a domestic-grade canning machine he had been fixing up. Some fugitive technicians from Kuznetsky Bridge are also willing to pitch in and help fix the machine, and provide materials, as long as the canned goods aren't stolen by the local yobs."

 TRT_shrimp_anyone:0 "Shrimp, anyone?"
 TRT_shrimp_anyone_desc:0 "The mutated variety of Shrimp are far too radioactive to consume, however much smaller non-mutated varieties still exist largely unaffected by nuclear fallout. Not as meaty or as delicate compared to its pre-war mass-farmed counterparts."

 TRT_arms_in_the_arms_industry:0 "Arms in the Arms Industry"
 TRT_arms_in_the_arms_industry_desc:0 "Our armed forces aren't in a particularly good shape. Most of our ranks are comprised of gopniks; loud, young and not very bright. A stereotypical image of bandits. Whats worse is they're strutting around with rusting guns fallng apart at the seams. To be truly feared we're going to seriously reconsider what we outfit our forces with"

 TRT_shooting_ranges:0 "Shooting Range"
 TRT_shooting_ranges_desc:0 "Yobs strutting around expecting to be embroiled into conflict is surely a powder keg waiting to innevitably burst. Stopping these gopniks from taking their frustration out on helpless citizens we can instead push their outbursts someplace else. Let them hone their trigger finger and aim at inanimate objects instead of animated ones."

 TRT_live_game:0 "Live Game"
 TRT_live_game_desc:0 "Instead of shooting at inanimate objects we could instead use live game. Our station does have a problem with rats afterall. It'd help cull their numbers afterall."

 TRT_technicians_trades:0 "Technicians Trade"
 TRT_technicians_trades_desc:0 "Fixing up armaments is more than just wiping it and keeping the stock shiny. Alot of intricate technican shit that many people don't have the patience or the intelligence for."

 TRT_hideout_for_kuznetsky_most:0 "Conceal refugees from Kuznetsky Brudge"
 TRT_hideout_for_kuznetsky_most_desc:0 "Kuznetsky Most lies relatively close to Venice, compared to having stark-raving bolsheviks or mutant shrimp as neighbours you'd chose the latter. The Red Line seeks to draw Kuznetsky Most under its sphere of influence much to the dismay of many of their citizens. Those who don't want to be under the iron boot of tyranny are seeking to packup and flee elsewhere. Why not convince them to take refuge at Venice?"

 TRT_armed_to_the_teeth:0 "Armed to the Teeth"
 TRT_armed_to_the_teeth_desc:0 "We're going to need to find, pilfer or make more guns to equip our military force. We're surrounded by meaner motherfuckers who would love nothing more than to fly their banner over the arches of our station community. Being extorted by the local mobniks is bad enough, but Hansa and the Red Line? They wont just milk us, but would love to skin us alive... figuratively speaking hopefully."
