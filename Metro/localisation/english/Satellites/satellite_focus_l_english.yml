 satellite_construction_1_desc:0 "It has been some 15 years since armageddon, and yet our citizens still live in filth and destitude. If anything [ROOT.capital.GetName] is in solid need of a sweep. Reconstruction efforts wouldn't entail much other than clearing out debris and removing the amount of garbage which clutters the station tracks, but would immensely help with the image of the station. The Beating heart of our community."

 satellite_defend_the_bulwark:0 "Defending the Bulwark"
 satellite_defend_the_bulwark_desc:0 "With miles of tracks stretching far deep into the underground, who knows what may lurk in the dark depths of the Metro? You've surely heard of the reports of mutant hordes which plague Sevastopol, or the ghosts which stalk the Arbatskaya Confederacy or even the freak rumours of lanky and dark eldritch beings which stalk the far away Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya line, and that doesn't include the more human threats of roving bands of Satanists or Nazis. Erecting measured defensive lines will make sure work that [ROOT.capital.GetName] doesn't become the new host of gossip of rumours."

 satellite_defensive_1:0 "Manning the Watchposts"
 satellite_defensive_1_desc:0 "With a perimeter line in place it won't do much to stop a bloodthirsty pack of Nosalis - we'll need more than just barbed wire to keep any watching gaze at bay. More bodies will be needed to peer into the dark depths of the undermetro... Lets just pray that nothing stares back at them."

 satellite_military_emplacements:0 "Military Emplacements"
 satellite_military_emplacements_desc:0 "Manned, with routine watchposts and rotational duties. Only thing left for our stockade is a centerpiece or two. Maybe a Flamethrower or two or even a DshK machinegun pilfered from topside? It wont come cheap, as nothing usually does, but we'll be wishing we had spent the extra bullets once our territory comes under attack."
