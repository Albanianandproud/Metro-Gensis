 metro_ruins:0 "Metro Ruins"
 metro_ruins_desc:0 "Untold miles of tracks, a myriad of countless winding and weaving passageways which penetrate into the dark recesses of the earth. decrepit darkness suffocating with forgotten beasts and the restless souls of the damned. This is now your home."

 hanza_redline_war:0 "Legacy of the Hanza-Redline War"
 hanza_redline_war_desc:0 "The bloodiest conflict the entire Metro has seen since the apocalypse between the Hanseatic League and the Red Line. The war quickly devolved into utter carnage; back and forth engagements, guerilla warfare, Entire stations and tunnels littered with towers of bodies. One side would take over a station, only for them to be pushed back later that very same day. Slowly the ware grew tiresome, exhausting the metro of resources and its population. It was clear that neither side would achieve victory. Whilst the true victor can be argued to be Hanza - it is clear to see the scars of that horrific conflict still permeates the denizens of the metro."
