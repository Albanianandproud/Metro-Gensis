  SPT_MILLER_NAME:0 "Melnikov"
  SPT_MILLER_DESC:0 "§9«He was serious, attentive, and even here, in this quiet, well-lit station, he gave the impression of being ready to face danger, of never being caught off guard.»§!\n\nA man of complexities and contrasts; Demanding, sometimes harsh, furiously practical, serious and focused, he seems at first glance to embody the ideal Stalker. Beneath the veil of the perfect soldier however lies the true makings of a hero. Melnik does not dare leave a wounded man behind if there is a glimmer he could be saved; his natural authority can reorganize a small squad gripped by fear in a flash. Everyone who knows Colonel Melnik regards him with a mixture of fear and admiration."
