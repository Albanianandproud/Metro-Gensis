 gunsmith_desc: "We currently do not have the technical knowledge nor manufacturing resources or properly create our own firearms, so we shall hire a set of experts to allow us to build a baseline for the production of arms."

 infrastructure_projects: "Infrastructure Projects"
 infrastructure_projects_desc: "Although many of our primary sectors, stations, and tunnels have previously been cleared and some even brought back to working order, much is to be done.

 gun_spec_ops_effort_1: "Stalker Operations"
 gun_spec_ops_effort_1_desc: "Stalkers are those who have the guts to venture onto the surface. The tales of dashing gas-mask clad troops evading watchmen or fighting demons ontop towers demonstrate a wild captivation the populace have for these daring heroes. Other stations have already began to set up their own stalker forces.. Why don't we?"

 military_tactics_2: "Organized Force"
 military_tactics_2_desc: "Our polity has existed through many years of strife and conflict.

 gun_draisines_effort_1: "Chop Shops"
 gun_draisines_effort_1_desc: "Many neighbours by now have managed to get ramshackled maintenance carts and trollys up into working gear. With a set of wheels we can sally forth men and supplies across our demense in a matter of mere minutes, rather than hours. We know that private merchants and trademen already use these buggies, but now nations such as the Hanza or the Redline are starting to shift into a motorized force. Those amongst us with dubious knowledge in engineering think we should try replicating this idea. Cracking open an old maintenance depot would be our best bet, though some even consider we have enough means at our disposal to begin entirely replicating Draisines from old, unused parts."
