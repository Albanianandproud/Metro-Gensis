 nf_BRK.1.t: "Lambda Core"
 nf_BRK.1.d: "The Scientists of the Kurchatov Institute would gladly help assist with supplying electricity to us in return for food. However rumours spread amongst the survivors that The Hare Krishna devotees holed up at the Oktyabr'skoe Pole station will someday make a breach into the institute itself, and attempt at blowing up the reactor. Simple rumours if you ask me."
 nf_BRK.1.a: "Their assistance would be much Appreciated"
 nf_BRK.1.tt: "As long as we aren't protracted into a war, we will receive their assistance."

 nf_BRK.2.t: "Letting the days go by"
 nf_BRK.2.d: "The Aviators, despite their aloof nature to outsiders seemingly agreed to help assist us. In return for much needed food they are willing to help retrofit our military workshops. Though we didn't get much of a glimpse of their so called «advanced» society, the technology which they lent to us seems frankly bizarre. Seemingly ancient pieces of Soviet electronic ware but designed to an unimaginably complex degree. Not even Bauman electronics could compare to the intricacies of the pieces of equipment they had supplied us. Still, no sign of robots or so called androids though."
 nf_BRK.2.a: "Their assistance would be much Appreciated- Wait, Who are the Baumans?"

 nf_BRK.3.t: "Big Trouble in Little Diamno"
 nf_BRK.3.d: "A recent incident has come to our attention right on the border between us than the Gulyai-Pole Republic. Anarchist forces have been moving across the border for weeks now, but however they do not heed the agreement set about by the two stations. Rude and arrogant, the anarchist forces trample on produce and when questioned by farmers simply ignore or outright threaten our citizens with their rifles. Rather than letting themselves be at the mercy of some thugs, our citizens mustered into a posse, and rather than waiting for the same band of anarchists to come trampling in drugged and drunk on moonshine, took the initiative and crossed the border to dispel mob justice.\n\nRumours are apparent that anarchist forces are coalescing together and seek to dispense justice upon the farmers."
 nf_BRK.3.a: "Lets not escalate the situation any further"
 nf_BRK.3.b: "Anarchists shot first!"
