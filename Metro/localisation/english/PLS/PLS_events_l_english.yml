  nf_PLS.6.t: "Castes of Polis"
  nf_PLS.6.d: "Just like Ancient India, the inhabitants of Polis are stratified upon a caste system. Hindu names for them among ourselves. Scientists are the Brahmins, the soldiers are the Kshatriyas, the merchants are the vaishyas, and menial labourers and engineers are the Shudras. People become members of a caste once and stay in that caste for the rest of there lives, with special rites of passage for Kshatriyas and Brahmins.\n\nThe Castes are represented by their respective ideology groupings. Maintaining a equal balance between a four castes, ensuring neither one has an unequal percentage of power within Polis will keep those castes in our favour."

  nf_PLS.6.a.tt: "The Castes of Polis are represented by Ideology. Keeping all 4 Castes in an equilibirium will allow us to pursue their respective Branches!"

  nf_PLS.9.t: "Elections"
  nf_PLS.9.d: "Each year, the Council of Polis is shuffled and seasoned members of the Brahmins or Kshatriya are allowed the opportunity to take a seat upon the Polis Council.

  nf_PLS.9.a: "Noted"

  nf_PLS.10.t: "Divisions of Power"
  nf_PLS.10.d: "Power in polis is divided between two castes; the Brahmins (Scientists) and the Kshatriya (Soldiers). Those who collect books and preserve the last dwindling knowledge that humanity has to offer; and those who protect those books from the darkness of the night. The Council of Polis predominantly comprises of these two sects, who in turn take on the decision of steering Polis towards meaningful goals and seek solutions during troubling times.\n\nEnsuring a perfect balance between Brahmins and Kshatriya members upon the council lies in our best interest."
  nf_PLS.10.a: "Good to know"

  nf_PLS.41.t: "Kshatriya: Urges more Workshops"
  nf_PLS.41.d: "It has been years since the Communist wars reach its conclusion, and in that time dissent has slowly stirred rearing itself to poke holes in the tenable peace which endures. Polis was the cauldron where the majority of the fighitng took place. Our military forces urge that we increase our military capabilities. Establishing several more Armament workshops will sedate our forces for the meantime."
  nf_PLS.41.a: "Noted"

  nf_PLS.42.t: "Kshatriya: Establish Regional Command"
  nf_PLS.42.d: "We can no longer reliably rely upon Hanza, or the Spartans to form the main bulwark of our defences. Our Generals urge us to deveope our command structure. Ensuring a rigid, yet flexible military structure will be more effective at maintaining our military forces."

  nf_PLS.43.t: "Kshatriya: Combat Exercises"
  nf_PLS.43.d: "Our Armed forces compose the main bulwark against potential threats. They must be constantly on watch, and remain vigilant for daring foes. Our General staff seek to conduct exercises throughout our armed forces and reservists alike."

  nf_PLS.44.t: "Kshatriya: Seeks to Conduct War Maneuvers"
  nf_PLS.44.d: "The first series of combat drills went better than previously expected. Our Staff seek to conduct another batch as immediately as possible. It would be wise to support them with whatever resources are needed."
  nf_PLS.44.a: "Noted"

  nf_PLS.45.t: "Brahmin: Seeking Research Grants"
  nf_PLS.45.d: "Even as the fires of Armageddon smothered the land and sea, Mans faustian spirit endured. Philosophy aside, our Science base still persists conducting experiments and research almost as if WW3 did not happen. That is, until their research is halted. As of late, we've seen an unexpected slowdown in Research Efforts. Our Brahmin urge us to set aside more funding towards our Research base. Human Progress must continue; whatever the cost."

  nf_PLS.46.t: "Brahmin: Improve Society"
  nf_PLS.46.d: "We live in a society. A human society. However taking a stroll down [PLS.Capital.GetName] will make you think twice any Homo Sapien survived the Nuclear Holocaust. First of all, our scientists urge us to imrpove general conditions around our stations; maybe even enforce a fortnightly bathing mandate. That would make things alot better for starters."
  nf_PLS.46.a: "Noted"

  nf_PLS.47.t: "Brahmin: Scientific Advancements"
  nf_PLS.47.d: "The surface awaits, even despite being blasted with radiation, filled with mutants and poisoned by the taint of harsh weather. Our scientists are envious about how exactly life continues to exist upon the surface; although extracting a live sample or too is strictly out of the question after last time, our Science base seeks to exploit the new landscape for all its secrets. Trivial or otherwise."
  nf_PLS.47.a: "Noted"

  nf_PLS.48.t: "Brahmin: Advance Scientific Advancements"
  nf_PLS.48.d: "The first experiments accrued much valuable research, but fail short in the eyes of our Scientists. Further experiments must be conducted if they are to remain content and in our good graces."
  nf_PLS.48.a: "Noted"
