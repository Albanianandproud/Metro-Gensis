 TRB_ZOLOTUKHIN_DESC: "Adding the role of Station Chief to his repertoire came easy, though the position was thrusted upon him by the collective will of the station rather than his own desire. Being the oldest, and therefor most logical and wisest to lead. Undistinguished from the other inhabitants, he'd much prefer to get his hands dirty and work amongst his peers, rather than sitting in a cramped maintenance room all day listing station supplies."
