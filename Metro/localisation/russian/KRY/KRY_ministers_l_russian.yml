  politics_KRY_vishin_desc:0 "Before the bombs dropped Vishin found himself meandering from one occupation to the next. Being the son of a former Colonel in the Soviet Army he always felt he had something to live up to. Feeling dejected from not being able to follow in his fathers footsteps.\n\nNow? He lives life with a clear purpose; to defend §Yhis§! station. §YHis§! family. §YHis§! home. He will personally see to it that §YKrylatskoe§! station remains safe and secured from outside threats. And with reports of §RMutants§! in the tunnels to the south, he will do whatever it takes to live up to his fathers legacy."
