 global_event.1.d:0 "Whilst battles still continue to rage on elsewhere in [PLS.GetNameDef], reports have come in that [Root.GetNameDef] have captured the station of [361.GetName]. Stalkers, Military personnel and citizens alike made a valliant attempt to smuggle out books belonging to the great repositories of knowledge safeguarded over the years. As fires burnt, smouldering up most of the stores only a handful of books were managed to be saved, the rest burnt to cinders.\n\nThe Great council chamber, which in times passed served as the negotiating point between Communist and Anti-Communist forces alike, now burns admist the backdrop of strife."

 global_event.2.d:0 "[Root.GetNameDef] Have confirmed they have managed to take the station of [304.GetName] today. As arms-fire can still be heard across the station, no significant Hanseatic counter-attack has yet been confirmed. Many Hanseatic soldiers making the ultimate sacrifice in the defense of [304.GetName], or simply allowing the escape of the stations more wealthier occupants to occur. Precious trinkets still line the walls, and  gutter up the tracks. Reports of [Root.GetNameDef] troops making off with war spoils and crates of military-grade bullets are unconfirmed, however. [304.GetName] is left in a heavily damaged state, and will take a incredibly long time to see the same levels of affluence it once had."

 global_event.3.t:0 "[275.GetName] Burns"
 global_event.3.d:0 "Despite Reich denial, the capture of [275.GetName] has been confirmed. With fighting described as tense, and the bodies littering the floor. The Dark Heart of the Reich has been broken. Fighting tooth and nail and laughing in the face of defeat, Reich soldiers stood and braced against the assailing forces. Despite fierce resistance, and even uncomfirmed reports of suicide bombing attempts by some ideologically fanatical Reich troops, they were pushed back out from [275.GetName].\n\nAs fighting has calmed down across the station, [Root.GetNameDef] have already began the attempt at De-Nazifying the station. Banners burnt and trodded on by celebrating troops, and Triskeles smashed to the floor. Just under a hundred years ago, the Reich was defeated by brave Russian souls, and now it has happened again."
 global_event.3.a:0 "The Reich will stand 'til the last man. To its last breath! Sieg!"
 global_event.3.b:0 "With the counterattack, everything will be alright... right?"

 global_event.4.t:0 "Siege of [330.GetName]"
 global_event.4.d:0 "At dawn, [Root.GetNameDef] troops smashed through the established bulwark of Redline Troops, and pushed into [330.GetName] proper.\n Thick billowing smoke poured across the station as fires loomed as the attacking soldiers stormed through. NKVD soldiers, alongside a small group of Redline Conscripts converted the Bolshoi theater into a makeshift fortress, but were ultimately forced out from the usage of explosives and flamethrower teams. Whilst some commissar holdouts still maintain control of some sections of the station, for the most part the battle for [330.GetName] seems to be drawing to its conclusion.\n\nDespite staunch orders from [RED.GetLeader] to deny citizens to retreat once fighting commenced, exceptions were made to Women, Children and many of the theater performers. Managing to slip out and escape well before the fighting gripped the station, however with their parent station in ruins. Performances have permanently been postponned until further notice."

 global_event.5.t:0 "Battle for [228.GetName]"
 global_event.5.d:0 "Slipping through the stations preliminary defences under the cover of darkness, [Root.GetNameDef] managed to quickly assail and overwhelm the defending garrison at [228.GetName]. As bloody hallway-to-hallway fighting ensued throughout the claustrophobic prison wards even for the likes of the underground, a small detatchment of [Root.GetNameDef] managed to unlock many of the prison cells, unleashing further havoc for the Defenders. Whilst many prisoners were indiscriminately shot beforehand, and many confidential research papers cast into flames before the stationed research team could evacuate under a detatchment of Redline Special Forces, the horrors which the walls of [228.GetName] witnessed will be banished to the confines of history, but surely will never be forgotten."

 global_event.6.t:0 "[350.GetName] Falls"
 global_event.6.d:0 "Fighting tooth and nail and down to the last comrade, [PREV.GetNameDef] had no alternative but to make a retreat from [350.GetName] following several hours of non-stop combat. The Station of [350.GetName] was used as a political prison to house many of the dissidents of the Redline, and in the Revolutions hour of need were made indispensable as engineers or as human shields suggested by [Root.GetNameDef] accounts.\n\nUltimately, Redline defenders chose to evacuate the station, not before one last attempt at sabotage however. Hoping to collapse the tunnels leading out from the station. This attempt was in vain however, curtailed before the operation could succeed."
 global_event.6.a:0 "You shall never break the spirit of the Revolution!"

 global_event.7.t:0 "Siege of [308.GetName]"
 global_event.7.d:0 "After hours of intense room-to-room combat, [Root.GetNameDef] has confirmed they have for the most part captured the station of [308.GetName]. Whilst a few sections of the station have yet to be properly cleared, Hanseatic Troops despite their valliant effort were forced to withdraw entirely from the station. Not without a bloody struggle however, as hastily erected barbed wire fields and improvised nail IEDs covered their tracks, which came at tremendous losses to both sides.\n\nDespite as the rattling of rifle rounds which can still be heard pinging off from the walls further down the Metro tunnel, an eerie silence falls upon whats left of [308.GetName]. Its only listeners are the corpses of its defenders."
 global_event.7.a:0 "The Battle is lost, but the war is not over"

 global_event.8.d:0 "Early today, it was announced that [359.GetName] had finally fallen into the hands of [Root.GetNameDef] forces. A key station in the Koltsevskaya line. Its economic affluence was once apparent, but now muchb of station tracks and central boulevard lay in ruins. Whilst much of the stations resources and economic assets were evacuated before fighting broke through into the station proper, a sudden fire had whisked much of the items to irreversable ruin. What scraps are left being picked off as war trophies by jubliant [Root.GetNameDef] forces. The Hanseatic League are yet to make a full statement regarding the fall."

 global_event.9.d:0 "[PREV.GetNameDef] had always anticipated the station would be under siege from its neighbour. Defensive barricades and military checkpoints stretching deep into the dark depths of the metro now lay in ruins. After numerous probing skirmishes by [Root.GetNameDef],and one solid push snapping the defending force into pieces, [418.GetName] remained ripe for the picking.\n\nFighting has all but ceased long after [Root.GetNameDef] boots firmly stepped upon the [418.GetName] side platforms. Much of the station lay in bitter ruins, and the hospital which was once considered large for the standards of the Metro obliterated under the hail of gunfire.\n\nReports coming in from [418.GetName] have all but ceased. [418.GetName] fate now within the hands of the Reich, whose hunger for conquest knows no limit."

 global_event.10.d:0 "It was announced today that the station of [312.GetName] has fallen into [Root.GetNameDef] hands. Even as the balance of power tilted and waigned against its Defenders, they ultimately chose to make a defiant last stand against the oncoming hordes of the Reich. Deciding to muster the surviving soldiers and blockade the exit tunnel leading out from [312.GetName]. Fighting did not cease until the last of [prev.GetNameDef] fell.\n\nMuch of the station now lays in ruins - picked apart and destroyed by the assailing force. Rubble litters the platforms and clog the track. Through bitter struggle ultimately came defeat."

 global_event.11.d:0 "Chaos snared up across the station, as the defending force were snapped into two. As pandemonium broke out across the ranks of its defenders, [Root.GetNameDef] made their assault. The battle was ruthless. Nothing which could be distinguished remains of the ramshackle buildings which lined the platforms. Now left burning smoke stacks and looming mounds of bodies and rubble. Much of [DIM.GetName] noq questioning his authority to government following the capture of [368.GetName]. A question left answered once peace can be achieved."

 global_event.12.d:0 "Facing fierce resistance even once the tides of the battle were tipped, [Root.GetNameDef] managed to push into [303.GetName] itself. To their horror, the soldiers of [Root.GetNameDef] were greeted with sickening images of execution and twisted and effigies lining the tunnel walls. The maddening cries of many of its victims still continue to pierce the walls of the station, even after [prev.GetNameDef] scurried back into the darkness.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] chose to take no prisoners, even those of the [prev.GetNameDef] who offered surrender were slaughtered without a second thought. Under heavy fighting the station were purged of its graphic imagery, but now comes the arduous process of rebuilding. As much as the tiles and walls of [368.GetName] are scrubbed, the station will never forget the sound of screams and gruesome sights it had witnessed."

Hordes of pale, striken cannibals assailed [Root.GetNameDef], who managed to keep them at bay with a steady hail of bullets. As defeat became immimnent, many of its twisted denizens chose to flee; scuttling into the dark depths of the undermetro. [Root.GetNameDef] chose not to pursue the routers however, as much to their horror they discovered children captured by [prev.GetNameDef] confined to cages and brainwashed to follow their sick beliefs.\n\nNow begins the long process of cleansing the station.

 global_event.15.d:0 "The capital of the [PREV.GetNameDef] has now fallen into [Root.GetNameDef] hands as reports describe. The seat of the once powerful Arbat Confederation now little more than a ghost station. The few numbers of evacuees were safeguarded from the station before fighting came close to its hermetic gates. Despite clinging on tooth and nail for every inch of ground, [PREV.GetNameDef] forces were pushed back by the overwhelming attacking force. Mounting offensives from [Root.GetNameDef] gave the defenders no other option but to withdraw their forces out from the station."

As barricades and makeshift emplacements dotted the station platforms, each one was smashed to pieces by [Root.GetNameDef] forces. Not after surmounting casualties however, untold numbers of bodies from either side still dot the station. Sporadic gunfights still ring from secluded places across the station as some holdouts still remain. Each one falling silently one by one."

Layered defensive lines piercing deep into the bowels of the earth were ultimately not enough to stem the tide of [Root.GetNameDef] troops, who managed to smash the defensive lines and make their way into the station proper. Many of the turbine generators were destroyed in the fighting - whether as a casualty from bullet fire or an intentional act of sabotage by [PREV.GetNameDef] forces remains uncertain however, but it appears they have been made inoperable. Destroyed beyond recognition. Furious clashes appear to be in vain, as the prize jewel of the station now lay in disrepair."

Reported that the defensive line was broken without a a single shot, and all that was left of the garrison were pools of fresh blood, the realization that it was useless to defend the northern reaches finally came to 1905s Leadership, who decided to evacuate and cut off the cursed stations from the Big Metro.\n\nSome explainations to the freak disappearance are tremors caused by the movement of an enormous creature slithering its path through the Underground, causing people to become panicked and crushing one another as they tried to escape. The rest died smashing their skulls  against the walls in a fit of hysteria, although that does not explain the disappearance of the bodies. Other explainations involve everything from Fascists slave raids,  Hare Krishnas all the way to the victims being swallowed up by a time warp beyond our possible explaination, but still remained unconfirmed and unfounded."

The SS and cultists alike have worked on setting up a government, with Danila Kreipp at it's center. \n\nAlthough the Fourth Reich has always been a collective of degenerate nazi scumbags, the attrocities and actions committed before will not come close to the things to come under Kreipp's regime.
