 RED_ministry_departments_desc:0 "Advisors can be improved through the usage of political power. Unique upgrade paths may be unlocked through focus rewards and events. The higher tier a department is, the more political power it will cost to maintain. You may scale-down or outright purge departments back to Tier I if necessary, however this will put said ministry out of commission for a short time. Be wary of giving certain departments to much power quickly however."
