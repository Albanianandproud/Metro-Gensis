  nf_VDNK.5.a: "NOPE"

  nf_VDNK.6.t: "Disaster!"
  nf_VDNK.6.d: "Disaster strikes VDNKh. For a while, it seemed Botanical was rid of mutants, but our arrogance was our undoing. Our settlers have been recklessly slain by mutants in. Our armed forces were overwhelmed. We stepped too far, and now suffer the consequences for our hubris."
  nf_VDNK.6.a: "This is terrible"

  nf_VDNK.7.t: "Hanza backs our Expansion"
  nf_VDNK.7.d: "Word of our expansion efforts have falling into the ears of the Hansa. Rather than sitting idly they seem to have taken a vested interest, and seek to fund our expansion. Obviously ulterior motives are at play, but those motives remain to be seen."
  nf_VDNK.7.a: "This will come in handy"

  nf_VDNK.8.t: "Hanza Withdraws Funding"
  nf_VDNK.8.d: "After catastrophe struck our settlers, news quickly spread and soon caught the attention of our Hanseatic backers who have withdrawn their support. "

 nf_VDN.1.t:0 "The State of the Commonwealth"
 nf_VDN.1.d:0 "The Commonwealth is made up of three stations, with VDNKH being its leader. Alekseyevskaya and Rizhskaya form the 2 member states. After being kicked out of the northern stations by the Dark One invasions, citizens of the Commonwealth have a deep resentment for the creatures to the north. \n \nPolitically, the Commonwealth cannot decide who it wants to be. Is it a centralized government with a unified command and political structure? Or is it a decentralized government with seperate government and military bodies. Only time will be able to tell which ideology the Commonwealth will take to survive."
 nf_VDN.1.a:0 "We must preserve the union!"

 nf_VDN.2.t:0 "The Elites of Vyskava"
 nf_VDN.2.d:0 "The elite soldiers that make up the Vyskava detachment are troublesome to say the least. They think very highly of themselves and seem to treat the station as their own damn shooting range. Althougb their capability in combat is second to none, the attitude of these soldiers are something to watch out for."
 nf_VDN.2.a:0 "These troubled soldiers must be dealt with"

 nf_VDN.3.t:0 "The Assault on the Gardens"

 nf_VDN.4.t:0 "The Colonel's Coup"
 nf_VDN.4.d:0 "The colonel and leader of the Vyskava detachment has taken control of the station and the government is nowhere to be found. What will become of VDNKH?"

 nf_VDN.6.d:0 "An envoy from [FROM.GetLeader] has approached us with a bold offer - the [FROM.GetAdjective] government wants us to give Prospekt Mira North to them for a non-aggression pact. While the details would still have to be worked out, many Army officers are deeply suspicious of the proposal, worrying that [FROM.GetNameDef] would stab us in the back as soon as our back is turned."
 nf_VDN.6.a:0 "Our compromises will pay off in the future."
 nf_VDN.6.b:0 "We can't trust them to keep their word."

 nf_VDN.9.t:1 "VDNKH demands Overlordship"
 nf_VDN.9.d1:0 "Following several weeks of feverish activity in the military of the VDNKH, [VDN.GetLeader] has issued a proclamation, declaring that the current situation in Sukharevskaya is a grave concern for the VDNKH, and demanding certain guarantees from us. \n\nAmongst other things, we would have to consult them before we enter any alliances or sign any treaties and would need to accept a military mission to coordinate our military."
 nf_VDN.9.d2:0 "A delegation from the VDNKH has arrived to discuss the issue of Sukharevskaya. They consider the country to be in their sphere of influence, and are greatly concerned by the influence we have on Sukharevskayan policy.\n\nThe leader of the delegation went so far as to suggest that Sukharevskayan territory may be used as a springboard to launch an invasion of the VDNKH.\n\nThey suggest that the government of the VDNKH should be permitted to wield a similar amount of influence on Sukharevskaya as we currently enjoy."
 nf_VDN.9.a:0 "Very well."
 nf_VDN.9.b:0 "Out of the question."

 nf_VDN.10.t:0 "Sukharevskaya is under our control"

 nf_VDN.11.t:0 "Control over Sukharevskaya denied"
 nf_VDN.11.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, the government of Sukharevskaya has refused to accept their subservient role compared to us. We must now consider the possibility of military action to secure our southern border."
 nf_VDN.11.a:0 "We will have it, one way or the other."

 nf_VDN.12.t:0 "VDNKH demands Sukharevskaya"
 nf_VDN.12.d:0 "The government of the VDNKH has approached us about the future status of Sukharevskaya. They strongly believe that they should have full control over the fate of Sukharevskaya, seeing how Sukharevskaya should belong to the VDNKH as it lays on the Orange Line too.\n\nWhile the delegation of the VDNKH shied away from issuing any explicit threats, our intelligence service reports an unsetlling amount of activity inside the military of the VDNKH."
 nf_VDN.12.a:0 "We have no choice."
 nf_VDN.12.b:0 "We will not yield an inch."

 nf_VDN.13.t:0 "Sukharevskaya transfered"
 nf_VDN.13.d:0 "Sukharevskaya is under our control. The question is now how we should organize it. While many in the government favor outright annexation, some others are worried about the effect of trying to integrate a half-bandit station into our commonwealth. Their prefered option would be to set up a devolved government in Sukharevskaya Station, with some powers over their internal policies, but closely aligned to us in all other matters."
 nf_VDN.13.a:0 "We will annex the station."
 nf_VDN.13.b:0 "A puppet government is preferable."

 nf_VDN.14.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] refuses to transfer Sukharevskaya"
 nf_VDN.14.d:0 "Negotiations about the transfer of Sukharevskaya have stalled almost immediately. The [From.GetAdjective] delegation has stated their position as essentially being the status quo, with no major changes proposed. Our delegation, of course, restated that we consider Sukharevskaya our territory, as it is on the Orange Line.\n\nNo progress has been made, and the increasing frustration on both sides of the table make it unlikely that any will be made."
 nf_VDN.14.a:0 "Let the issue go."

 nf_VDN.18.d:0 "Sukharevskaya Station is not far from the newly gained station of Prospekt Mira North. Whilst trade caravans routinely pass through the station, we know very little about the goings on in the station itself. We know however, there is a small population living at the station. It is in the state of total anarchy. Prime target for colonization!"
 nf_VDN.18.a:0 "The station was infested with bandits. Quick! To Arms!"

 VDNnews.3.d.b:0 "Clinging tenaciously to their independence, the Sukharevskayans have rejected the demands of the VDNKH, and are fortifying their border. The VDNKH has made no effort to de-escalate the situation, and both nations seem set on a course to war."
