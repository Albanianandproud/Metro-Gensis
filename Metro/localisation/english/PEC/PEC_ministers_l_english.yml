 PEC_STEPANOV_DESC: "With age comes wisdom. But no amount of it could forsee the collapse and regression of Muscovite Society. Stepanov who initially believed he was dawning upon his sunset years immediately found himself knee-deep in the proverbial shit. Despite reluctant at first, he found within him he contained a strong, natural aplitude for leadership. His peaceful and amiable governance of the republic quickly spurred on a resounding age of peace his little slice of the Metro. Although within recent years his mental state has weigned slightly; no longer as sharp or as shrewd as he once was. The Republic finds itself sliding ever so slowly back into the dark. But Stepanov still permeates a bold aura even his few of his most adament of critics cannot reasonably tilt their nose towards."
