 nf_metro.1.d:0 "Welcome to the Metro HOI4 Mod. Currently the mod is in the Early Alpha stage of Developement. As of the initial release, the mod is being worked on by a single developer. So keep that in mind when encountering any of the numerous bugs, game breaking issues other such unintended hijinks. Updates and fixes should be gradually rolled out over time. With decent content updates hopefully rolling out every other week or so. \n If you encounter any bugs or glitches, please let it be known in the Discord or through Steam. Or if you want to give suggestions or constructive criticism. Anything is Appreciated. \n Hope you enjoy the mod! \n- Albanian."

 scavenge_mission.2.d:0 "The expeditionary team have returned, albeit, with their tails between their legs. They were unsuccessful in exploring and reclaiming what we had hoped them to achieve."
 scavenge_mission.1.t:0 "Scavenge Successful"
 scavenge_mission.1.d:0 "The Scavenging mission was a success. Our Stalkers have returned with goods and equipment brought back from the surface. Ontop of that they recall discovering 3 distinct spots within the ruins of Moscow we can send further expeditions to. However they believe, considering the caustic nature of the surface most of the discoveries will be picked bare or waypoints scuffled by the turbulent weather. We may only chose one of these 3 points of interest to further send an expedition to."
