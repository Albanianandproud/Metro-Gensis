## num_controlled_stations : amount of stations which can be calculated
## num_controlled_civ : amount of CG you gain tax from
## num_controlled_inf : amount of infrastructure you gain tax from
## num_controlled_battalion : manpower cost (per battalion)

## total_expenses : the total expense 
## bullet : how much money in stockpile
## gross_income : total income before deductions 
## net_income : after deductions equates to net
