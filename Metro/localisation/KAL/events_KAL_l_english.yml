With a voice that trembles with both age and conviction, he recounts the splendor of the Russian Empire, claiming to be a direct descendant of the Romanov dynasty. His tales are filled with vivid descriptions of grand palaces, noble battles, and the majestic rule of his supposed ancestors.\n\n"But beware," he warns, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper, "for modern technology is a curse upon our land. It is a tool of the devil, leading us away from the true path of our forebears. The machines and gadgets, they poison our souls and corrupt our children. We must return to the old ways, the ways of the Tsars, to reclaim our glory."\n\nThe children listen with wide-eyed fascination, captivated by his stories and the passion with which he speaks. To them, he is a living link to a forgotten past, a storyteller whose words paint a picture of a world long gone.

They corrupt our souls and drive us away from the true path of our ancestors!"\n\nThe craftsman looks up, bewildered and concerned, as the group surrounds him. "I'm just doing my job." he protests, wiping sweat from his brow. "These tools are essential for our survival and progress."\n\n"Progress?" the old man scoffs. "This so-called progress is a lie! We must return to the old ways, the ways of the Tsars and the Romanovs. Only then can we reclaim our true glory!"\n\nThe supporters jeer and shout, creating a tense and hostile atmosphere.

They form a line between the protestors and the administration center, urging the crowd to disperse peacefully.\n\nBut the old man is undeterred. "We will not be silenced! The Empire still lives!" he cries out, pushing forward. His followers follow suit, the confrontation teetering on the edge of violence.\n\nThe tension reaches a breaking point when some protestors begin to throw objects at the authorities.

The streets are filled with the clamor of conflict, as brother turns against brother in a brutal struggle for power.\n\n"We fight for our heritage, for Orthodoxy, and for the true Romanov bloodline!" the old man cries from his makeshift command post, rallying his troops with promises of a return to the glorious past.\n\nOpposing him, the loyalist forces are determined to preserve the stability and progress of the Confederation. "We cannot let this madness destroy us. For the future of Kalininskaya, we must stand firm!" declares a Council leader, directing defenses and strategies to quell the uprising.\n\nFamilies are torn apart, communities divided as the civil war rages on.

With ruthless efficiency, the Master-at-Arms, the Grand Inquisitor, and the High Minister have orchestrated a brutal purge to eliminate any opposition to their rule.\n\nIn the main square, the High Minister addresses the fearful populace, his voice cold and unwavering. "Those who oppose the divine will of the sun, those who reject the light of the Empire, shall face the consequences of their heresy. This is the dawn of a new era, one that will be cleansed of darkness and dissent."\n\nThe Grand Inquisitor, cloaked in dark robes, leads the purge with a merciless hand. Individuals deemed traitors or heretics are dragged from their homes, their pleas for mercy falling on deaf ears. Public executions become a common sight, serving as grim reminders of the Holy Hierarchy's absolute authority.\n\nThe homes and tunnels of Ploschad' Il'yicha and the surrounding stations are filled with an eerie silence, punctuated by the occasional screams and cries of those being purged. The Master-at-Arms ensures that any remaining resistance is swiftly and brutally crushed, his forces patrolling the area with unyielding vigilance.\n\nThe faithful of the Holy Hierarchy watch in solemn approval, convinced that these harsh measures are necessary to establish the Empire of Light. They believe that only through such radical purification can their vision of a radiant future be realized.\n\nAs the purge continues, fear and uncertainty grip the hearts of the citizens. The once hopeful dream of a new dawn has turned into a nightmare of tyranny and bloodshed, casting a dark shadow over the promise of the Faith of Sol."
