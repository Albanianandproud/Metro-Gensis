  communist_collectivization:0 "Collectivization"
  communist_collectivization_desc:0 "Great Strides should be made to properly organizing & managing our station. How will we take the fight against the powers which be, if we can't effectively cooperate between all facets of our society?"

  communist_gas_lighting:0 "Gas-Lighting Fixtures"
  communist_gas_lighting_desc:0 "Its not known what exactly lurks within the dark. Be they those looking to despoil the revolution or even more sinister. We must remain vigilant. Installing proper lighting would better serve rotational duties between our garrison forces."

  communist_preliminary_defences:0 "Preliminary Stockades"
  communist_preliminary_defences_desc:0 "The enemy could strike at any time and at any place. Having prepared defensive structures would be wise."

  communist_tunnel_clearing:0 "Tunnel Clearing"
  communist_tunnel_clearing_desc:0 "Its safe to assume our operations will stretch all across the metro. But we shouldn't be caught off-guard from suprise attacks.

  communist_industry_3:0 "Technician Training"
  communist_industry_3_desc:0 "Ofcourse getting to point A to point B underground is a linear endeavour. It'd be much quicker, and easier to get there on a trolly. Problem is, much of the trollies and utility carriages we have found lay in rusting-mess. Luckily enough, we know just the right person to help repair them."

  communist_using_the_terminal:0 "Cracking the Computer"
  communist_using_the_terminal_desc:0 "A passing trader offered us a bargain deal for this old computer. Apparently it was taken from an old Central Metro Command Officer.

  communist_scrapping_for_parts:0 "Scrapping for Parts"
  communist_scrapping_for_parts_desc:0 "Despite its age, it stands in remarkable condition. Besides? Why would we need the information? These parts are better used elsewhere."

  communist_industry_5:0 "Putting the computer to use"
  communist_industry_5_desc:0 "Its pretty crazy what these old computers can get up to. Almost revered as some ancient mystical artefact by the youth. We can put it to good use helping out R&D efforts."

  communist_industry_6:0 "Salvaging old Tooling"
