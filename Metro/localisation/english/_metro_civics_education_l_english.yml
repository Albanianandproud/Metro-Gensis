 improve_education_efforts_administrate_station_chiefs_desc:0 "Meeting with our station administratiors to formulate and blueprint the procedure of implementing these reforms will take time. Even if they agree with our proposals. Only by respecting local chiefs authority can we properly go ahead with our desired reforms whilst also ennacting our desired changes."

 improve_education_efforts_collect_books_desc:0 "Instead of using books as fuel for our burn barrels and campfires we could instead keep them safely away. Ensuring they're kept in decent conditions away from decomposing elements."

 improve_education_access_polis_repository:0 "Access Polis' libraries"
 improve_education_access_polis_repository_desc:0 "We're sitting in the dark trying to reinvent the lightbulb whilst Polis retains any information that we may seek. Instead of banging sticks and stones together we could politely ask if we are allowed access to their knowledge reserves. Albeit distrusting of permanently lending us any books or pieces of knowledge to keep, incase of some idiot mistaking possibly the last intact book from Dostoyevsky as fire kindling. Surely a community dedicated to the preservation of humanity and the safeguarding of knowledge would let us take a brief peek?"

 improve_education_efforts_HANZA_unique_1: "Invest in our Research Base"
 improve_education_efforts_HANZA_unique_1_desc: "Money doesn't exactly make the world go round, but it greases palms and makes things go smoother. We cant exactly throw money at our populace, and expect them to become literate. However can can afford to 'place' some spare change here and there. Especially when it comes to our Administrative base. Sure, the station walls are leaking slime again, and Igors scrap-gun has jammed for the upteenth time today, but we could really do with some more books."

 improve_education_efforts_HANZA_unique_2_desc: "Some amongst Administrators argue that if we seriously want to improve the education of our populace we should probably start from the very bottom and prioritise the education of our youth.

 improve_education_bandit_desc:0 "The word 'bright' or smarts doesn't come to mind when it comes to a band of thugs and goons. Street-smarts sure, but how many hoodlums does it take to screw in a lightbulb? Better not asking that around these parts. Though its clear if we're going to be running the underground we'd better start somewhere. Whipping the lads into shape from being a disparate band of boneheads."

 improve_education_efforts_bandit_mission:0 "Improving Education Efforts"
 improve_education_efforts_bandit_mission_desc:0 "Its going to take a fair while until we start seeing improvements. Honing in the knowledge and foresight of our crew might not make them be able to solve even the most basic of mathematics, but it'll refine their street-smarts certainly."

 improve_education_efforts_bandit_disceting_equipment_desc:0 "Throw a book from Tolstoy infront of any wiseguy and he'll hurl it back towards you. Its gonna take more spit and elbow grease than trying to get the lads to educate themselves. More practical approach is gonna be needed"

 improve_education_efforts_bandit_pp_spend_desc:0 "Ocourse all thug in the green are looking to earn their stripes. They're looking to be the next Mikhailov or Kurgan Terminator.

 nf_metro_education.2.t:0 "Education Reforms"
 nf_metro_education.2.d:0 "After a tiresome amount of weeks, the bumfucks in our outfit are finally getting the jist of it. Who would've thought these knuckleheads could amount to anything other than shooting and drinking? Igor no longer stutters profusely when he's reading the various tabloids of pop-gossip from over two decades ago. Whilst Piotr can actually write out his name now. A motely crew of thugs today, who knows about tomorrow? Maybe we'll make the soldiers of Hansa think twice fuckin' around with us!"

 nf_metro_education.5.b: "Best to leave it to the station authorities"
