 nf_BAU.1.d: "Our scouts have reportedly discovered tunnels across Sparrow Hills which directly lead into the fabled Emerald City. They had observed Emerald City Stalkers making their way to and from these entrances and after a sour first contact the two groups began to familiarize themselves with one another. It is true; and from the hushed whispers of Emerald City Stalkers it outwardly seems they believe the rest of the Metro to be inhabited by luddites and barbarians. However an exception was made to our collective."
