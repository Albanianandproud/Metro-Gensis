  DRY_pakhan: "The Master of Dry Station"
  politics_DRY_pakhan_desc: "Calling himself the 'Master' thanks in no part to steering the Dry Station bandits to where they are now. Formerly serving as a distinguished military general to the Red Line. Its not unclear whether he mutinied out of losing faith towards the Red Lines leadership or the ideals of Socialism itself. Craven, Manipulative and Cruel, the perfect talents for a leader of a band of blood-wretched misfits."
