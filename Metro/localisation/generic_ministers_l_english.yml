  metro_electronics_manufacturer_desc:0 "Being a former undergraduate engineer before the bombs dropped, he was easily able to become a citizen of the Baumansky Alliance, from where he was further taught and learnt to hone and refine his craft, in refrabricating and repairing pre-war electronics and military-grade equipment.\n\n However, after a unfavourable scandal where he was blamed for the disappearance of highly-secretive processing methods, he ran and fled the Alliance before he could be brought to trial.\n\n From there he offered his services to anyone who could afford them as an engineer. Using his taught and his §Y'found'§! knowledge to do what he does best."

  metro_industrial_manufacturer_desc:0 "Before the bombs dropped, he worked as a plant manager of a factory located outside Moscow. Whilst often than not his job pertained to overseeing workloads and the various operations which made the inner-cog work flawlessly, he now finds himself advising and overseeing the implementation and usage of ramshackle and retrofitted industrial processes within the metro."

  metro_strings_puller_desc:0 "Knowing how to discretely and covertly manupulate political ongoings to control and influence others into to his way of thinking, he found a relatively easy time conforming to the inner-politiking of the Metro. Never afraid to use underhanded tactics, though always prefering to keep his hands clean."

  metro_scientist_desc:0 "A former Brahmin from Polis. His eccentric, yet dubious methods of collecting, and carrying out scientific information drew the ire of many of his former colleagues. He took to the wider metro to further his understanding in scientific knowledge. Prefering the bedlam and freedom rather than the systematic methods, rational and 'principled' means back at Polis."

  metro_accountant_desc:0 "Working a dead-end office job before the Apocalypse would probably equate to nil-chances of survival in the aftermath. However instead he found his frugal and shrewd talents were put to good usage; managing and overseeing the logistical aspects of a post-nuclear society. Though just like before, still being relagated to menial, bureaucratic jobs. Though this time his work meaning the survival of the human race, rather than profits to a indignant corporation."

  HNZ_whataburger_will_desc:0 "Hailing from the United States, he is often at times seen as benign and amiable. A soft-spoken man, despite his extensive knowledge in jurry-rigged firearms and retrofitted small-arms. Despite language barriers still persisting, He's wiling to oversee our weapons production. Although folks distrust him for his nationality; the same nation instigating World War 3."
