 nf_TRT.10.t:0 "Sunken Crevasse"
 nf_TRT.10.d:0 "The crevasse itself lay only several meters in length, and about half that number in diameter. Cracking and baked into the stonework of the Metro tunnel, the initial exposion blast seemed to have revealed the hole, rather than creating it; as if it was behind the concrete facade this entire time. Inspecting the walls of the hole itself appeared more as if the ground itself gave way, rather than some natural formation. Tossing stones down the hole has proven to indicate that there is infact a bottom, however from the sound reverb it seems to stretch down almost a hundred feet or so, expanding into a larger chamber at the bottom. An otherwise unassuming hole which has captivated Gennadys imagination. At first curious, quickly became a maddening obsession exploring the depths before it ran the risk of flooding. Firmly believing he along with two other volunteers could squeeze down the hole and reach the bottom.\n\nDespite the warnings and objections he refused, whatever he saw glimmering within the abyss had swallowed his curiosity whole, gnawing away piece by piece at his mind.\nTaking supplies with them, they descended down the Crevasse, 24 hours later and with no reports of their return it appeared as if they are still down there. As water rises eventually the hole will be flooded, and Gennady and his expedition members will be swallowed by the water. And now if you put your ear close to the opening, you can almost hear faint wailing and murmuring."
