  ### Infantry Technologies ###

  gas_mask_2013: "Basic Gas Mask"
  gas_mask_2013_desc: "A gas mask made for civilian use from before the war. They will keep a person safe from some contaminated environments, but are overall only hardly equipped to deal with the kind of places the Metro will put them up against."
  gas_mask_2029: "Improved Gas Mask"
  gas_mask_2029_desc: "An improved model of gas mask, making more dangerous areas accessible to scavengers and soldiers."
  gas_mask_2030: "Military-Grade Gas Mask"
  gas_mask_2030_desc: "A mask made specifically for the military, for use in protecting soldiers from field concentrations of chemical and biological agents, as well as radiological fallout particles."
  gas_mask_2031: "Cold-War Era Gas Mask"
  gas_mask_2031_desc: "Cold-War Era Gas Mask"
  gas_mask_2033: "Special Forces-Grade Gas Mask"
  gas_mask_2033_desc: "A gas mask which features improved performance against chemical and biological agents, toxic industrial chemicals, and nuclear fallout. Also, a higher field of view allowance. The mask also comes with a self sealing filter mount that allow for filter changes even in contaminated environments."
  gas_mask_2034: "Spartan-Grade Gas Mask"
  gas_mask_2034_desc: "These gas masks are much the same as the previous iteration of gas mask, however, they are reinforced and allow for more extended combat encounters without as much risk to them taking damage that would cause them to be unusable."
  gas_mask_2036: "Pre-War Gas Mask"
  gas_mask_2036_desc: "On the eve of war the Russian Government knew conflict was fast approaching. As a means to gain the technological edge over America they developed a new Gas Mask impervious to weather conditions and radiation. Knowing that war may very much be fought on Russian Soil, it was a last-ditch attempt to develop equipment which could be used in the eventuality of nuclear war. It only entered a prototype stage, and intended usage to be used in Siberia and the Artic Circle where America was believed to stage landing invasions through discrete operations. No more than several of these exist, and only a handful were ever produced. Destined to stay hidden behind closed doors."

  scrap_infantry_equipment_tech_2: "Finned Barrels"
  scrap_infantry_equipment_tech_2_desc: "Attaching finned barrels to our Bastard Guns will allow for easier cooling, thus reducing the chance of damage due to overheating." 
  shotgun_infantry_equipment_tech_2: "Improved Stocks"

  conventional_infantry_equipment_tech_2: "Extended Magazine"
  conventional_infantry_equipment_tech_2_desc: "A larger magazine means more bullets immediately available to the soldier, as well as a greater capacity for sustained and suppressive fire."
  conventional_infantry_equipment_tech_4: "Holographic Scope"
  conventional_infantry_equipment_tech_4_desc: "Holographic sights, while more complex than irons, allow for the shooter to enjoy a clearer sight picture, and greater peripheral vision."
  conventional_infantry_equipment_tech_6: "Military-Grade Ammunition"
  conventional_infantry_equipment_tech_6_desc:0 "Despite it being a currency commonly used in the metro. Why cant we use it as bullets?"

  pheumatic_infantry_equipment_tech_2: "Steel Alloy Bolts"
  pheumatic_infantry_equipment_tech_2_desc: "As preparation for the development of the Helsing, we will develop bolts made of forged steel, durable enough to punch through body armor and glass."

  pheumatic_infantry_equipment_tech_4: "Explosive Arrows"
  pheumatic_infantry_equipment_tech_4_desc:0 "Strapping explosive bolts on the end of our arrows goes without any question that it provides more firepower than conventional bolts. if the bolt cant go through kevlar, it will certainly blow it into shrapnel. Thats for sure."
  
  entrench_kits_2027: "Simple Militia Drills"
  entrench_kits_2027_desc: "The first and most important aspect of the modern metro soldier is discipline. The discipline to hold the line against mutants, the discipline to return fire instead of cowering in fear, and the discipline to follow orders without question. Without discipline, you cannot have an army."
  entrench_kits_2028: "Basic Militia Drills"
  entrench_kits_2028_desc: "Coordination is key, but does not come naturally. Men must be taught to understand orders, to speak only when needed to, and to work together in small units."
  entrench_kits_2029: "Advanced Militia Drills"
  entrench_kits_2029_desc: "Though most of our military is at this point a semi-professional militia, it's important to impose a certain standard of physical fitness, enough to manage long treks through the tunnels or to operate supply-bearing railcarts."
  entrench_kits_2030: "Rudimentary Army Drills"
  entrench_kits_2030_desc: "The transition from militia to professional army comes with many changes, the first of which is uniformity. Rag-tag self supplied kit is replaced with standardized uniforms, helmets, and boots."
  entrench_kits_2031: "Advanced Army Drills"
  entrench_kits_2031_desc: "Field fortification and entrenchment are both vital to defensive operations in the metro; even without dedicated engineer companies, soldiers are expected to know how to construct barricades, fill sandbags, and deploy razor-wire."
  entrench_kits_2032: "Comprehensive Army Drills"
  entrench_kits_2032_desc: "Soldiers should be expected to handle taking care of their kit. Training soldiers on how to maintain their rifles, replenish their medical supplies, and sew shut holes on their uniforms will mean that everyone goes into battle at their best."
  entrench_kits_2033: "Fundamental Special Forces Drills"
  entrench_kits_2033_desc: "Soldiers under the new training regimen will operate at the peak of human performance. (By Metro standards, anyway.) Long hikes through uninhabited tunnels, endurance training and strength building exercises are all things culiminating in our modern men of steel."
  entrench_kits_2034: "Complex Special Forces Drills"
  entrench_kits_2034_desc: "With the raised standards in the military, so too comes a raised degree of responsibilities and battlefield freedom. Group and Unit Leaders, who before would be left out of the planning stages, can now be relied upon to take objectives into their own hands."
  entrench_kits_2035: "Rigorous Special Forces Drills"
  entrench_kits_2035_desc: "Close Quarters Combat, or CQC for short is a constant issue in the Metro. Cramped tunnels filled with tens, sometimes hundreds of troops, can lead to offensives sometimes coming down to the melee. Drilling troops in both armed and armed melee combat will give them an invaluable set of skills."
  
  clothing_kits_2027: "Insulated Clothing"
  clothing_kits_2027_desc: "Cold is a constant worry in the metro, doubly so during winter. Making sure soldiers have multiple layers, wool gloves, and radar caps will provide some very needed defense against the cold."
  clothing_kits_2029: "Padded Clothing"
  clothing_kits_2029_desc: "While not bulletproof, padded clothes can mean the difference between getting the wind knocked out of you, and having your ribs broken. They're also great for insulating against the cold."
  clothing_kits_2031: "Basic Body Armor"
  clothing_kits_3021_desc: "Thin steel plates can be inserted into makeshift carriers and worn over the chest to protect from both blows in melee, and low caliber gunshots. Though heavy and unwieldy, these chestplates might just save your life."
  clothing_kits_2033: "Improved Body Armor"
  clothing_kits_2033_desc: "Salvaged Kevlar from from prewar body-armor can be fitted into well insulated clothes and recycled helmets. While these measures would still fold in the face of full rifle rounds, they provide excellent protection against pistol rounds and buckshot."
  clothing_kits_2035: "Heavy-Duty Armor"
  clothing_kits_2035_desc: "Full body suits of either Ceramic or steel plates. These massive unpowered suits can only be worn for a short time on the front, lest our men become fatigued."

 tech_explosive_stock_desc: "A large round carries with it a large amount of recoil. That's why our grenade launchers would benefit from reinforced stocks with recoil pads."

 tech_explosive_flechette: "Flechette Grenades"
 tech_explosive_flechette_desc: "The Flechette Grenade is a happy middle ground between the fragmentation and nail grenades. These metal darts enjoy the compact size of fragments, and the armor piercing capability of full length nails."

 tech_explosive_high_explosive_pill: "High-Explosive Grenades"
 tech_explosive_high_explosive_pill_desc: "High Explosive Grenades are build entirely around getting as much bang for your buck as physically possible. They excel at demolishing fortifications and stationary positions, but are lacking against solid armor."

 tech_explosive_revolving_chamber: "Revolving Chamber Mechanism"
