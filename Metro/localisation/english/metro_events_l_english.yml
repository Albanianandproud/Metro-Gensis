So keep that in mind when encountering any of the numerous bugs, game breaking issues other such unintended hijinks. Updates and fixes should be gradually rolled out over time. With decent content updates hopefully rolling out every other week or so. \n If you encounter any bugs or glitches, please let it be known in the Discord or through Steam. Or if you want to give suggestions or constructive criticism. Anything is Appreciated. \n Hope you enjoy the mod! \n- Albanian."

 reclaimation_event.mutants.d:0 "The expeditionary team have returned, albeit, with their tails between their legs. They were unsuccessful in exploring and reclaiming what we had hoped them to achieve.\n\n They give brief descriptions of the ghostly silence, and then the resounding and tunderous sounds of screams echoing all throughout the tunnels, reverbing from the walls and ceilings before suddenly, more sounds. Iregular and broken staccato of hundreds of mishapen footsteps, scurrying towards the team. The team prepared themselves, but it was not enough, grotesque mutants enveloped the team. Waves crashed against the bulwark and not before long; ammo supplies quickly dried up. Even before those hideous beasts ceased pouring from that dingy abyss.\n\n It was more than a miracle that atleast some of them made it back in one piece. However, it was more than just mutants they saw in those tunnels. Whatever they were, the team reluctant to give descriptions. For they tremble and quake to recollect those horrifying moments."
