 GWC_worm_military_1: "Warriors Call"
 GWC_worm_military_1_desc: "There are few amongst our flock who could best the Warrior in combat. Its unknown where about he came from, with some believing he was brought to us by the Great Worm himself. Only Priest, and Warrior himself know and they seldom seek to tell. Neither man, wicked or sacred has ever found themselves crossed in his maddening ire, and lived to tell the tale."

 GWC_worm_military_2: "Doped Shrooms"
 GWC_worm_military_2_desc: "The mushrooms which grow within our tunnel networks retain peculiar properties. Whilst looking withered and decaying, they possess hypnotic, almost magical properties.

Preist believes not, however our warriors are adament upon ingesting these mushrooms before going into battle. As they believe the imagery may predict future outcomes of battles to be, and to come."

 GWC_worm_military_7: "A Culture of Conflict"
 GWC_worm_military_7_desc: "Humanity has, and always will be a society built solely upon the bones and carcass of itself. No other being is able to wage war as complete and as effective as man.

As Reverance and wretched chants are pledged in his name. Those bellows clang from the decaying walls of the underground, becoming faint muffled howls and squeals. Moans of innumerable throats of vile beings can be heard coming from Victory Park. Beats snare and drum, and spitroasts blaze. Neighbouring stations tremble under anxiety of whats about to come.

 GWC_KRY:0 "Heathens from the North"
 GWC_KRY_desc:0 "Krylatskoye lays under the watchful eye of Vishin, its station master and chief. Running the station more like a military encampment than a functioning station.
