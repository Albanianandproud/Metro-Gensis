 tech_flamethrower_equipment: "Flamethrower Equipment"
 tech_flamethrower_equipment_desc: ""

 tech_flamethrower_pneumatic_airtight: "Airtight Pneumatic System"
 tech_flamethrower_pneumatic_airtight_desc: "Having a tighter nozzle on the fuel delivery system will allow for more directed use against tough targets."

 tech_flamethrower_pneumatic_automatic: "Automatic Pneumatic System"
 tech_flamethrower_pneumatic_automatic_desc: "The ease of use in an automatic fuel delivery system will only further enhance the killing power of the flamethrower."

 tech_flamethrower_extended_tank: "Extended Tank"
 tech_flamethrower_extended_tank_desc: "Though heavier, larger fuel tanks mean more time in the fight before soldiers need to retreat and refill."

 tech_flamethrower_petrochemical: "Petrochemicals"
 tech_flamethrower_petrochemical_desc: "Using a tailor-made petrochemical mix in lieu of our previous fuels will enhance the killing power of flamethrowers."

 tech_flamethrower_gas: "Gasoline"
 tech_flamethrower_gas_desc: "Switching over to gasoline means that the burning fuel will become more likely to drip down into the inconvenient crevices that armor would normally shield."

 tech_flamethrower_high_capacity_pneumatic: "High-Capacity Pneumatic System"
 tech_flamethrower_high_capacity_pneumatic_desc: "More advanced Pnuematics means the flame jet can fire over farther distances, hitting unsuspecting troops from almost twice the distance!"

 tech_flamethrower_equipment_2: "Improved Flamethrower Equipment"
 tech_flamethrower_equipment_2_desc: ""

 tech_gatling_equipment: "Gatling Equipment"
 tech_gatling_equipment_desc: ""

 tech_gatling_barrel: "Six-Barrel Assembly"
 tech_gatling_barrel_desc: "Increasing the number of barrels from three to six will allow us to greatly increase the rate of fire, as the heat will be distributed over a larger number of barrels."

 tech_gatling_engine: "Engine"
 tech_gatling_engine_desc: "Installing a small electric engine to the weapon means the operator will no longer have to hand crank it to turn the barrels, leaving them to focus on aiming and firing the weapon."

 tech_gatling_stabiliser: "Gyro Stabilizer"
 tech_gatling_stabiliser_desc: "A gyroscopic stabilizer installed into the Gatling gun would make the recoil much more manageable, and more shots actually landed on target."

 tech_gatling_support: "Recoil Support"
 tech_gatling_support_desc: "Bipods, tripods, and the rare quadpod will make managing this beast in defensive positions a lot less taxing on gun teams, as the weapon can be fired without being actively lifted off the ground."

 tech_gatling_spring_mechanism: "Mechanically-fed Spring Mechanism"
 tech_gatling_spring_mechanism_desc: "The current limited factor on the Gatling's rate of fire is how fast we can actually pull bullets into the gun. Using mechanical springs this can be remedied, allowing for an even more brutal hail of bullets."

 tech_gatling_magazine: "Extended Magazine"
 tech_gatling_magazine_desc: "Now that guns can be stabilized with recoil pods, we can increase the weight of the weapon with a larger magazine, cutting down the time spent reloading the weapon in a fight."

 tech_gatling_equipment_2: "Improved Flamethrower Equipment"

 tech_explosive_equipment: "Explosive Equipment"
 tech_explosive_equipment_desc: ""

 tech_explosive_fragmentation_grenade: "Fragmentation Grenades"
 tech_explosive_fragmentation_grenade_desc: "Fragmentation Grenades are an absolute classic from before the war. Excelling at shredding both flesh and wooden fortifications, these bombs will again find their place on the battlefield."

 tech_explosive_fragmentation_nail_grenade: "Nail Grenades"
 tech_explosive_fragmentation_nail_grenade_desc: "Nail Grenades are a newer invention in the metro. Cheaper, more brutal, and more effective against armor, nail bombs eject a cloud of nails wildly in every direction."

 tech_explosive_stock: "Stock Support"
 tech_explosive_stock_desc: "A large round carries with it a large amount of recoil. That's why our grenade launchers would benefit from reinforced stocks with recoil pads."

 tech_explosive_flechette: "Flechette Grenades"
 tech_explosive_flechette_desc: "The Flechette Grenade is a happy middle ground between the fragmentation and nail grenades. These metal darts enjoy the compact size of fragments, and the armor piercing capability of full length nails."

 tech_explosive_high_explosive_pill: "High-Explosive Grenades"
 tech_explosive_high_explosive_pill_desc: "High Explosive Grenades are build entirely around getting as much bang for your buck as physically possible. They excel at demolishing fortifications and stationary positions, but are lacking against solid armor."

 tech_explosive_revolving_chamber: "Revolving Chamber Mechanism"
 tech_explosive_revolving_chamber_desc: "Double the grenades, double the fun! A revolving cylinder with six slot grenades instead of the previous three means that launchers will cause twice as much destruction before needing a reload."

 tech_explosive_equipment_2: "Improved Explosive Equipment"
 tech_explosive_equipment_2_desc: ""
 
 tech_recon5: "Recon Company V"
 tech_recon5_desc: "Maintaining contact with a few local spy cells in enemy territory will ensure we always have a fresh batch of intel coming in."
 
 tech_recon6: "Recon Company VI"
