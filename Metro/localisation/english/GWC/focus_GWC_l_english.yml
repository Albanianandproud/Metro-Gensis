 GWC_worm_military_1_desc: "There are few amongst our flock who could best the Warrior in combat. Its unknown where about he came from, with some believing he was brought to us by the Great Worm himself. Only Priest, and Warrior himself know and they seldom seek to tell. Neither man, wicked or sacred has ever found themselves crossed in his maddening ire, and lived to tell the tale."

 GWC_worm_military_2: "Doped Shrooms"
 GWC_worm_military_2_desc: "The mushrooms which grow within our tunnel networks retain peculiar properties. Whilst looking withered and decaying, they possess hypnotic, almost magical properties. People who have eaten them describe seeing vivid images and hearing loud, almost deafening voices. May it be a direct communication link to the Worm himself? Preist believes not, however our warriors are adament upon ingesting these mushrooms before going into battle. As they believe the imagery may predict future outcomes of battles to be, and to come."
