 nf_TRT.2.t:0 "Flooding!"
 nf_TRT.2.d:0 "Despite our best preparations, we were ultimately at the mercy of the rising tide. Flooding has taken its toll on our community, and a hefty chunk of our infrastructure lay wasted."
 nf_TRT.2.a:0 "Damn"

 nf_TRT.3.t:0 "Venice"
 nf_TRT.3.d:0 "Whilst Venice is filled with representatives of the criminal world, there still persists a large percentage of ordinary folks. There is no true centralised power within Venice, so power is split between acting Mobsters and Civilian groups. Although most often the Venetian mobsters or 'Tretyakov Brotherhood' mostly partake within extortion and blackmail to achieve power, which has drawn the ire of many from the community."
 nf_TRT.3.a:0 "Noted"
 
 nf_TRT.4.t:0 "Flooding Issues"
 nf_TRT.4.d:0 "As you may know. Venice sits on prime real esstate with major factions laying around us all eyeing one another preparing for their time to strike out. Yet we share our own set of problems. If you haven't already noticed, Tretyakovskaya is partially flooded. Runoff rain-water pours down from the surface following the thaw season. If we are not prepared enough the rising tide runs the risk of flooding our station even more, destroying our community.\n\nAlongside other swimming mutants which come from the surface this proves a growing problem. We must constantly be on guard."
 nf_TRT.4.a:0 "Noted"

 nf_TRT.5.t:0 "Flooding Immiment"
 nf_TRT.5.d:0 "Flooding season will arrive soon, meaning that we must prepare adequate measures to direct water away and stall flooding leading to Venice."

 nf_TRT.9.t:0 "Dealing with the Shrimp"
 nf_TRT.9.d:0 "Not only do the shrimp infest swamps and stagnant bodies of water on the surface, they also infact linger within the depths of the metro too. Whilst shrimp hatchlings aren't difficult to be put down, the larger counterparts are more deadly. Especially when they are grouped in large numbers. Disrupting supply lines and trade. They're the apex predator in their environment and clashes with humans will continue until their nests are destroyed."
 nf_TRT.9.a:0 "We'll have to find a way to deal with them."

 nf_TRT.10.t:0 "Sunken Crevasse"
 nf_TRT.10.d:0 "The crevasse itself lay only several meters in length, and about half that number in diameter. Cracking and baked into the stonework of the Metro tunnel, the initial exposion blast seemed to have revealed the hole, rather than creating it; as if it was behind the concrete facade this entire time. Inspecting the walls of the hole itself appeared more as if the ground itself gave way, rather than some natural formation. Tossing stones down the hole has proven to indicate that there is infact a bottom, however from the sound reverb it seems to stretch down almost a hundred feet or so, expanding into a larger chamber at the bottom. An otherwise unassuming hole which has captivated Gennadys imagination. At first curious, quickly became a maddening obsession exploring the depths before it ran the risk of flooding. Firmly believing he along with two other volunteers could squeeze down the hole and reach the bottom.\n\nDespite the warnings and objections he refused, whatever he saw glimmering within the abyss had swallowed his curiosity whole, gnawing away piece by piece at his mind.\nTaking supplies with them, they descended down the Crevasse, 24 hours later and with no reports of their return it appeared as if they are still down there. As water rises eventually the hole will be flooded, and Gennady and his expedition members will be swallowed by the water. And now if you put your ear close to the opening, you can almost hear faint wailing and murmuring."
 nf_TRT.10.a:0 "Corden off the crack, don't let anything IN or OUT!"
 nf_TRT.10.b:0 "On second thoughts, send an expedition to see whats down there"

 nf_TRT.11.t:0 "We struck too deep"
 nf_TRT.11.d:0 "With only a few hours to act, a hastily organized expedition was established to search for the missing men below. Our initial predictions for the tunnel turned out to be true as the crevasse opened up into a large natural cave chamber. With branching tunnels leading off from the main chasm. A natural cave system located right underneath moscow itself. Signs of activity were minimal, even mutants who would have otherwised used the cavern were unfounded. The search party scoured the near vicinity for the missing members of the first expedition and would inturn discover the members cowering in one of the wayside caverns.\n\nWildly distraught at first the first expedition took a while to calm down their nerve. One of the members had suffered a fracture to their femur bone, and another had stumbled and grazed their knee evading what they could only describe as a demon.\n\nThe Expedition are being escorted back now, however all but one are accounted for. Gennady is still missing. The expedition claimed he had tried to ward off the demon, so that the members could escape, leading the creature further into the cavern depths as he fired upon the demonic entity. However with water rapidly rising his discovery must be made soon or the entire crew will be swept away from the tide."
 nf_TRT.11.a:0 "Cut our losses and fall back. He is far too gone."
 nf_TRT_11.b:0 "Continue searching for him"

 nf_TRT.12.t:0 "Elusive Discovery"
 nf_TRT.12.d:0 "After another labourious hour of searching we finally managed to find Gennardy. Bloodied and bruised perched ontop of a rock as the water level was rising all around. He was bleeding out, but was alive and able to communicate apart from the occasional slurred word. He told us the he did indeed encounter this demon creature. A tall-slender humanoid creature which tried attacking the group. Gennardy unfurled several rounds at the creature - it dropped, but before getting back up again un-affected by the rounds. Gennardys mind thumped and rang with a ear-piercing ringing noise as the creature tried to make its way to Gennardy. Gennardy remembered long-forgotten memories which he believed he had all but lost. Feeling his mind slipping Gennardy clutched the trigger one last time, and the beast dropped, pointing towards the far end wall of the tunnel where he had slain the beast. Yet the water was too high up to notice any lingering corpse. The water now stretched up to the waist - too difficult to investigate.\n\nWith only moments to spare before the entire cave would be flooded, the expedition team alongside the rescue team made their escape. Many disregard Gennardys claim, believing his encounter was merely a hallucination or a trick of the light. Gennardy however is silent to dismiss or to argue. He may have saved the lives of his fellow friends, but he swears that whatever he believed had shot dead was not infact killed, but rather still haunts him to this day."
 nf_TRT.12.a:0 "Gennardy, return home"

 nf_TRT.13.t:0 "Big Problems in Chinatown"
 nf_TRT.13.d:0 "Kitay-Gorod is not far from the Bandit Triangle. Also an independent station from any of the larger political entities in the metro. Ruled by two opposing gangs which has caused widespread anarchy and lawlessness. The station is colloquially referred to as 'Chinatown' "
 nf_TRT.13.a:0 "Racial conflicts or not, we are still bound by a code amongst thieves"
 nf_TRT.13.b:0 "We must stick together"

 nf_TRT.14.t:0 "The Mobsters"
 nf_TRT.14.d:0 "Four gangs stalk the Kaluzhsko-Rizhsky line. Disunitied within, however on the outside they appear to act as a united entity. This is not however the case, the bandit groups operate with a large amount of indepenence amongst one another. An any other entity has yet tried to annex the stations they occupy."
 nf_TRT.14.a:0 "Despite their internal conflicts, we still stick to an oath"
 nf_TRT.14.b:0 "Us mobsters stick to our own"

 nf_TRT.15.t:0 "Silo Expedition"
 nf_TRT.15.d:0 "Despite the spiderbug infestation, we managed to assail the mutants. Battling floor to floor, room to room, even through the vents. The missile silo in question was in a bad state of disrepair, even before the war it seemed as though the site had been in a dishevelled state. Unfortunately, the missiles in the silos themselves had been spent. But what we did find instead was..."

nf_TRT.16.d:0 "It is true, the place we unsurfaced did infact contain occupants. They claim to revere and worship Victor Tsoi, a long now deceased legendary figurehead of russian music. They follow closely his teachings and core philosophy."
nf_TRT.16.a:0 "They are free to reside in Venice"
nf_TRT.16.b:0 "I'll have you know this Depot is ours for the taking!"

 nf_TRT.17.b:0 "Second thought, lets not."

nf_TRT.18.t:0 "Confrontation at the Border"
nf_TRT.18.d:0 "Recent reports indicate the bandits of Venice are amassing troops at our borders. Though they have yet to state their intentions, its obvious to see they are seeking to probe our defenses. This is not the typical scan however, since they would have already tried running down our security forces. They are planning for something, whatever their dense brains could achieve is beyond us, but we must be ready."
nf_TRT.18.a:0 "Damn Bandits"

nf_TRT.19.t:0 "Victory"
TRT_borderwar_RED_WIN:0 "The Army of the Sokolnicheskaya stood firm, managing to best the bandits in armed conflict. Despite their underhanded tactics our forces managed to route the invading force. We'll be sure to anticipate their attacks again in the future."
TRT_borderwar_TRT_WIN:0 "The plan worked flawlessly, damn commies didn't even know what hit them before it was too late. Weekend conscripts ain't no match for our boys. Nobody fucks with Venice thats for sure."
nf_TRT.19.a:0 "Ok"

nf_TRT.20.t:0 "Defeat"
TRT_borderwar_RED_LOSE:0 "Somehow, the army of the Sokolnicheskaya were bested in combat by nothing more than a rag-tag army of bandits. The Marauding group from Venice slipped through our defences and defeated our armed forces. Whoever is responsible for this embarrassment surely has their name on a NKVD checklist by now."
TRT_borderwar_TRT_LOSE:0 "It was pretty obvious how the conflict would go down. What? A bunch of thugs against the largest standing force in the Metro? Don't kid yourself there, the battle was decided before it had even began. Though we got a few of those Red Bastards didn't we? Better than shooting at metal targets I assure you."
nf_TRT.20.a:0 "Damn"


 nf_TRT.22.t:0 "Battle of Titans"
 nf_TRT.22.d:0 "The Redline have gone to war against the Hanseatic League, and so we must commit to our part of the deal... However..."
