 ARB_tvaltvadze:0 "Giorgi Tvaltvadze Kolpakov"
 ARB_TVALTVADZE_DESC:0 "A stern, heavy man who currently acts as the President of the Arbat Confederation. Of caucasian descent, Tvaltvadze oversees the wellbeing of the confederation."

 ARB_semyonovich:0 "Arkadiy Semenovich"
 ARB_SEMYONOVICH_DESC:0 "The current station chief of Kievskaya, a shaven, neat man despite the onset of old age. Once serving in the Army many years ago now finding himself overseeing the day-by-day activities required to keep his community in working order.\n\nIts known by a handful of people that Semenovich has a fondness of liquor. The expensive variety. Belief has it that he will pay good bullets for pristine wine, and not the cheap tat the Stalkers routinely stagger back from topside."

 ARB_arman:0 "Arman"
 ARB_ARMAN_DESC:0 "A tradesman of Armenian descent, Arman carries himself as a stern figure; many who meet him recount of his focused glare. After the coalition wars, he had found his living attempting to fix many of the wares found topside. Clocks, doo-dads with articular mechanism. With enough bullets coming in he managed to convince Stalkers to take to the surface, searching otherwise irrelavant objects to bring back to him. Whilst Many Stalkers would otherwise moan and grumble at the bequest of picking and combing piles of rubble for rather basic tat. Not a particularly easy demand, when you could be looting old government buildings or factories, but Arman ensures expenses are covered the cost of collectment.\n\nDespite his affluence, Arman prefers an altruist livestyle. His home is typical to others in the community and he much prefers to help where it is needed than to sit on his ivory tower and hoard his money. Although his benevolence tends to steer more towards other Caucasians alike rather than Russians."

 ARB_khandukht:0 "Khandukht"
 ARB_KHANDUKHT_DESC:0 "Revenge is an act of passion; Vengeance is an act of Justice\n\nKhandukh is a woman of Armenian-Russian Descent. Fleding to the Arbat Confederation like many did during the advent of World War 3. Most folks didn't care about the war; about the petty politiking or who did this or that, only that their lives were torn apart. Families, loved ones torn apart. That life would never be the same again. Despite the situation humanity found itself in, life goes on, it had to. So life went on for Khandukht, marrying a former veteran of the Coalition war and the two raised a child.\n\nHer life would come crashing down, following her husbands untimely murder in his living quaters, and their son subsequently snatched. Instead of admitting defeat, laying down in the dirt and submitting to the cruel mercy of the universe, driven by sheer vengeance she pulled all her belongings together and sold them off in order to afford enough gear and ammunition to venture to the surface as a Stalker. Clicking up with a group of stalkers who at first looked down towards her. She soon found her footing in the profession and proved to be just as resourceful and daring as much as her male counterparts, which garnered their respect. Determined to eventually seek some semblance of closure to her grief and an end to the sleepless nights she had endured until this point.

 ARB_islam:0 "Islam"
 ARB_ISLAM_DESC:0 "The bravest hearts are those who keep to Allah; even when they are in pain.\n\nIslam was the only son of a Imam who sought refuge to the Moscow Metro when Islam was 15. His father was born in Chechnya and lived through both Chechen wars. Despite first-hand accounts of atrocities commited on both sides during the war, his father disdained from picking up a rifle; much to the dismay of the members of his village. Even as a missile struck the building him and his village community sought shelter inside; thusly killing a dozen or so of his peers.\n\nTaking his pacifist philosophy into the grim darkness of the 2nd decade, he had hoped his son would follow in his footsteps. Ultimately, Islam would lean away from his fathers world perspective following the Coalition wars. As refugees fled the newly formed Red Line to seek shelter away from persecution; only to be denied asylum and gunned down for so called anti-revolutionary actions, his own father being one such victim.\n\nAs his teenage years wained he found Allah once more."
