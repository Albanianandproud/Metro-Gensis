 random_event_vagrants.01.t: "Vagrants in the Tunnels"
 random_event_vagrants.01.d: "Noises are heard coming from deep in the tunnels, right on the border of our territory. The sound of incomprehensible muttering and voices, which appear to sound human. A team sent to investigate discovers the sound coming from a band of vagrants skulking in a maintenance hall to the side of the tunnel. There they have established a rudimentary camp. With only the belongings on their back as respite. Some of the members wielded rather crude, however sophisticated hand-weapons made from scrap. They speak in an unfamiliar language yet strangely greeted your team with open arms. As communication between the vagrants was established by using gestures and sign language you discover they originated from the southern Metro. They had lived from place to place, never stopping. Headed by their patriarch, who had recently passed following an encounter with a frightful demon they now find themselves leaderless and wish to settle down."
 random_event_vagrants.01.a: "Let them join"
 random_event_vagrants.01.b: "Turn them Away"

 random_event_vagrants.a_tt: "§gDespite being foreigners, they appear to be well meaning folk. We open our door to them as friends!§!"
 random_event_vagrants.b_tt: "§gOur citizens come first unfortunately, the influx of an unknown alien group may make our own populace grow uneasy§!"

 random_event_glitters.01.t: "Glitters in the Dark"
 random_event_glitters.01.d: "One of the tunnel guardmens swears he sees something shine in the darkness. Every rotation when he returns back to station he spots a shimmer from beyond the tunnel in one of the old maintenance side paths. He is unable to investigate since said tunnel has been boarded up, with only a slight glimpse to see through. The Tunnel in question was boarded up years ago due to mutant incursions deep in that tunnel. The man stands by his guns, saying it isn't the trick of the light or his imagination. There is something down there, and wishes to investigate."
 random_event_glitters.01.a: "Remove the Barricade"
 random_event_glitters.01.b: "Best not to"

 random_event_glitters.02.t: "Mutant in the Tunnel"
 random_event_glitters.02.d: "The Wooden barricades were pryed open to reveal what was behind. Beyond the absolute void lay nothing. Then a hundred tiny beady white eyes pierced the darkness. There was a reason why that tunnel was closed. Today we recieved a grim reminder of why so."
 random_event_glitters.02.a: "Damn!"

 random_event_glitters.03.t: "Nothing of Value"
 random_event_glitters.03.d: "The Wooden barricades were pryed open to reveal what was behind. Beyond the absolute void lay nothing. Where the soldier said he could spot the speckles of light laid nothing. A blackened circular shape imprinted on the floor and on the ceiling. It smelled like a mixture of burnt rubber and sulphur. Whilst strange to say the least, nothing of value was found. The barricade reinburst and quickly that tunnel was forgotten again."
 random_event_glitters.03.a: "Damn!"

 random_event_glitters.04.t: "Something Lost, Something Found"
 random_event_glitters.04.d: "The Wooden barricades were pryed open to reveal what was behind. Beyond the absolute void lay nothing. A preliminary search held no account of the glimmers, and the search was about to be called off until the bouncing light off one of the flashlights revealed a sparkling in the darkness. A beam of light directed towards the glimmers revealed the soldier was speaking the truth infact. What lay beyond was..."
 random_event_glitters.04.a: "A Cache of Rare Metals"
 random_event_glitters.04.b: "A crate of Armaments"
 random_event_glitters.04.c: "A trove of valuable Trinkets"

 random_event_station_babbler.01.t: "Station Babbler"
 random_event_station_babbler.01.d: "A strange man has started to rant in the middle of the station. Whilst he is off of his work duties he'll stand, perched ontop of an old soap box and rant about the most amusing of topics. From fringe beliefs about how 'Eurasia will Unite' and Humanity must dig down to reach the legendary below-kingdom of Agartha. To more humorous topics such as the notion that the Metro was infact built by Intelligent Gnomes in the 4th century who used the metro system to hide and store their absurd amounts of Kvass. Whilst the children sit and listen to his insane babbles, many of our citizens deject it. They find his rants somewhat amusing. A tinfoil-wearing, but rather harmless old man"
 random_event_station_babbler.01.a: "Kick him Out"
 random_event_station_babbler.01.b: "Let him stay"

 random_event_station_babbler.a_tt: "§gHarmless, it still doesn't give him an excuse to rant and rave about nonsensical topics. Spending his time scaring the children with false tales. Give him a boot up the ass and tell him to go his own way.§!"
 random_event_station_babbler.b_tt: "§gHe's a harmless old man, and brings an comical comfort to the daily lives of the stations citizens. Although he knows too much about the§! §OMetro Gnomes§! §gfor his own good...!§!"

 random_event_scientist.01.t: "Science gone too far?"
 random_event_scientist.01.d: "One of our scienctists has proposed an idea to substantially boost our science base. However his experiments are deemed 'unorthodox' and extreme even by our standards. He reassures his research will only be used for the goodness of our administration, and means only to do well."
 random_event_scientist.01.a: "This will help our research efforts"
 random_event_scientist.01.b: "We cannot afford to spend the resources right now"

 random_event_printers.01.t: "Printing Presses post slander"
 random_event_printers.01.d: "Our stations printing organization has recently published several news articles critical of our current regieme. The article, encroaching borderline on just slander aimed at poking jabs at our administrative committee. Many of our citizenry have read their news articles, and could become motivated to push against our administration. How should we proceed?"
 random_event_printers.01.a: "Scrap the printer for spare parts"
 random_event_printers.01.b: "Ban them from printing for a time"
 random_event_printers.01.c: "We shouldn't interfere"

 ## Education events##

 random_event_civics.01.t: "Child Seriously Injured in work Accident"
 random_event_civics.01.d: "A child got distracted during work and suffered a fatal injury. I will share you the grizzly details, what is more pressing is the childs injury has sparked mass resentment in our citizenry regarding our policy on child labour. Perhaps as a means to save face, and to get back into the good graces of our populace we should yield to the mob?"
 random_event_civics.01.a: "Perhaps we should change our policy?"
 random_event_civics.01.b: "We don't have enough hands to meet labour demands. I'm sorry."

 random_event_civics.02.t: "A Desperate Mother"
 random_event_civics.02.d: "A mother has refused to let their child attent work in fear of them getting injured or worse. Station authorities are at standby willing to interviene. However this would undoubtedly cause alarm, and may further inspire resentment in our populace. Perhaps, we could look the other way and make an exception?"
 random_event_civics.02.a: "Perhaps we should change our policy?"
 random_event_civics.02.b: "We'll make an exception under this circumstance"
 random_event_civics.02.c: "We wont make an exception"

 random_event_civics.03.t: "A Letter of Gratitude"
 random_event_civics.03.d: "Amongst the pile of letters sent to our station administration one stood out. A letter written by a mother of [ROOT.GetName]. The note describes that their were unable to pursue education in their youth and despite the current state of the world, they hold immense appreciation and gratidue to our administation for allowing their child to have an education they lacked."
 random_event_civics.03.a: "Thankyou"

 random_event_civics.04.t: "Child killed in Work Accident"
 random_event_civics.04.d: "There has been an accident! A child worker was injured whilst at work. Despite attempts to save them, they ultimately did not pull through. Unsuprisingly this has sparked a time of mourning across the station where the accident took place. A makeshift cross has been erected where the child perished. People leaving few material tokens to mark their respect. Whats worse, is that this has sparked outrage also. Vandals have graffitied 'CHILD MURDERERS' along the station walls. Many citizens are distraught with the unfortunate accident, and this may spark more outrage towards our administration."
 random_event_civics.04.a: "We should change our policy this instant"
 random_event_civics.04.b: "Remove the grafiti and tell our citizens its back to work"

  ### War ###

  random_event_war.1.t: "Accusations of Draft Dodging!"
  random_event_war.1.d: "A recent scandal has been brought to light divulging that our Station Administration have been pulling strings to avoid sending their associates up to the draft. After being investigated for charges and subsequently aquited has only lead to a resounding uproar across our citizens. The recent misconduct of power could have serious reprecussions for our authority, and could perhaps sow the seeds of discontent among our population which could further be a disaster for the war effort."
  random_event_war.1.a: "Disgraceful, send them to the front"
  random_event_war.1.b: "Side with the administration"
  random_event_war.1.c: "The Enemy are on our doorstep, we have better things to prioritise!"
  random_event_war.2.t: "Question of Rationing"
  random_event_war.2.d: "The question which lies on the wordless lips of every one of our citizens. Our population is used to grueling hardships, especially now of all times when the enemy threaten to break down our very doorstep. However, with resources being directly pulled from the civilian sphere to support our lads fighting the question has been arisen of whether more resources should be allocated and tighter restrictions placed on scarce resources. This would surely be dissaproved by our population, but may win us the war."
  random_event_war.2.a: "This may be a necessary evil that we will have to commit to"
  random_event_war.2.b: "The war is going well, we do not need to jeopardize our conviction with the populace"
  random_event_war.3.t: "Resentment against Rationing"
  random_event_war.3.d: "With restrictions upon certain goods being put in place, rising discontent towards our current reigme has only festered. Reports of a rising 'black market' of sorts to circumvent resource-stamp system ennacted has only made our popularity fall amongst our citizenry as a result. Perhaps it is in our best interest take this into consideration and perhaps relax the current restrictions?"
  random_event_war.3.a: "Stop your whining, this is for your own good"
  random_event_war.3.b: "Perhaps a stepping restrictions back would be ideal"
  random_event_war.4.t: "Alarming News from the Front"
  random_event_war.4.d: "Recent reports coming from the front are distressing indeed. Whilst the war continues to rage with no explicit end in sight, our beleaguered soldiers are facing more difficult sorties by the day, and with casualties mounting. The battlefront can only be described simply as carnage. Shrapnel and bullet squelch and blanket the metro tracks and corpses far too decomposed and rotted to be identified left to fester and be eaten by rats.. Perhaps this is hell."
  random_event_war.4.a: "If our citizens sees those reports, they could condemn our war"
  random_event_war.4.b: "Do not let these reports come out!"
  random_event_war.5.t: "Reports from the Front"
  random_event_war.5.d: "Recent reports from the frontline have come through. Whilst the war still rages with no explicit end in sight, the actions of our soldiers can only be described as courageous. We should let their bravery and feats be known and perhaps it would further inspire committment towards our population"
  random_event_war.5.a: "This is what we needed"
  random_event_war.5.b: "We can spin this, somehow"

  ## detained

  random_event_detained.1.t: "Diplomatic Incident"
  random_event_detained.1.d: "A recent transgression has come to our attention. A diplomat sent on political relations to our station has recently gotten himself into hot water. If seeking to negotiate amiable political relations was drinking to his hearts content and pitching bar fights with patrons to go by then he infact is going a good job rousing the local populace. We have detained the drunken diplomat, however we cannot force any justice reprecussions on the individual. However throwing him out of our station may indeed sour our relations with the Diplomat as a result."
  random_event_detained.1.a: "Theres nothing we can do, which wouldn't cause diplomatic harm"
  random_event_detained.1.b: "Throw out the Diplomat"
  random_event_detained.1.b_tt: "Recipient nation will not like this seemingly rash decision."

  ## Peace ##

  random_event_victory.1.t: "To the Victors..."
  random_event_victory.1.d: "The War is over! A time to count of the cost of collateral, and human damage, reforge the peace and draw up plans for any future war. Our officials have suggested to [ROOT.GetLeader] to display our military might and prowess we should conduct a military parade in [ROOT.Capital.GetName], just like the military marches of old. It would undoubtedly serve to boost public morale."
  random_event_victory.1.a: "A display of our supreme authority and victory will surely suffice"
  random_event_victory.1.b: "Just a little public display will do"
 
  ### Disappearance Event Line ###

 random_event_disappearance.01.t: "Disappearance"
 random_event_disappearance.01.d: "We have received a worrying report from one of our outposts on the border of our territory next to some abandoned Metro tunnels. According to the messenger, a routine patrol has failed to report for several days. While such an occurrence isn’t necessary alarming by itself, with guards often being delayed, forgetting to check in or outright deserting, the families of these men have reported them missing and are begging us to send someone to find out what happened.\n\nhe outpost commander has personally vouched for the loyalty and capability of these men, and requests that he be allowed to send another team to investigate the fate of the missing patrol, arguing if the cause behind the disappearance of the guards isn’t looked into, there is a possibility that we will suffer further casualties. Nonetheless, the final decision on whether to probe the tunnels remains with us."
 random_event_disappearance.01.a: "Tell the commander to investigate! We must bring those boys home"
 random_event_disappearance.01.b: "Better safe than sorry. Order the outpost commander to stay put"

 random_event_disappearance.02.t: "Equipment Discovery"
 random_event_disappearance.02.d: "We have just received a grim report from the investigative team. After several hours, they came across the equipment of the missing patrol stashed away in a crevice. It is clear that this was done in a hurry – no effort was made to properly camouflage the abandoned weapons, hence allowing for its easy discovery by our team.\n\nWe cannot say for sure what happened to the missing patrol. Why they would decide to abandon their armour or weapons and flee further into the tunnels is beyond our understanding. The only clue that we have is the thick pungent of musk and sulphur that lingers in the tunnel."
 random_event_disappearance.02.a: "Dammit. Order the Team to return at once!"

 random_event_disappearance.03.t: "Lost Patrol Discovery"
 random_event_disappearance.03.d: "We have just received some fortunate news from our investigative team. After several hours, they were able to find the missing patrol hiding in a crevice in the abandoned metro tunnel, frightened and babbling incoherent nonsense, and were able to return them back to their outpost.\n\nOur interrogation of them to determine what happened hasn’t met much success, however. All we were able to glean from them is that while the guards were doing their routine patrol, they came across some tall slender humanoid like figures who were impervious to bullets. After attempts to put them down failed, the guards fled further into the tunnels and hid until we found them.\n\nThis explanation leaves us with more questions than answers. Who these humanoids are, what their intentions were and how they are able to be immune to our attacks is something that we will probably never know unless they reveal themselves once more."
 random_event_disappearance.03.a: "Chilling. Order the Team to return at once."

 ## BAD ##

 random_event_bad.1.t: "Rats!"
 random_event_bad.1.d: "These aren't just the typical rats. They are large, black-furred, with long curling tails. Preying under the cover of darkness and gnawing their way through just about anything. Getting into our food supplies and feasting upon unwarying piglets. Even worrying reports is that they are unfased by any attempts of our civilians at scaring them off. Accounts even depicting them scurrying and gnawing at children and corpses. Whatever the case may be, more emphasis on rat catching must be put in motion."
 random_event_bad.1.a: "Damn!"

 random_event_bad.2.t: "Bandit Ambush!"
 random_event_bad.2.d: "One of our Caravans were recently ambushed making its routinely trip between stations. Outgunned the caravaneers fled, leaving behind their likelyhood. Our soldiers should have no problem dealing with the bandits, however our budding tradesmen are unwilling, or too nervous to venture out of the station for the time being."
 random_event_bad.2.a: "Drat!"

 random_event_bad.3.t: "Fallow Fields"
 random_event_bad.3.d: "Whether through poor maintenance, overworking the soil or some freak pathogen, our farm plots are withering. Expected yields are much below what we need to keep our citizens supplied. Rationing is due which will put strain on our already sullen populace."
 random_event_bad.3.a: "Damn"
 random_event_bad.3.b: "We can use our soldiers, to help toil and restore our agriculture"
 random_event_bad.3.c: "Dip into our finances and buy more Food"

 random_event_bad.5.t: "Occupied Station disobedience"
 random_event_bad.5.d: "One of our recently occupied stations has been suffering from anti-administrative partisans conducting sabotage operations. However in recent days their actions are primarily aimed at stalling our local station chiefs from effectively controlling the population of the state. The populace have become increasingly frustrated with our occupation, and whilst no outward conflict has spilled over, the current trajectory of the station almost makes it seem likely."
 random_event_bad.5.a: "Don't test our patience"

 random_event_bad.6.t: "Sabotage in our Occupied Station!"
 random_event_bad.6.d: "One of our recently occupied stations have been suffering from guerillas for the longest time. However the issue has only festered with the foes sabotaging our stations local workshops. The whole district was engulfed in flames from the ensuing fire, and whilst eventually the flames were quelled, what was left of was only ruins. It will take a while before we can effectively repair the workshops, and resume their operation."
 random_event_bad.6.a: "Thats not good"

 random_event_bad.7.t: "Fire! Fire!"
 random_event_bad.7.d: "A recent fire has ensnared one of our stations into a state of panic! Thankfully the fire has been put out before it could fully plunge the station into flames, the damage has gripped the station as many houses and buildings have crumbled into ash by the torrents of the firestorm."
 random_event_bad.7.a: "There is nothing we can do, other than simply rebuild"

 random_event_bad.8.t: "On the Fritz"
 random_event_bad.8.d: "It seems like one of our generators is on its last legs. After months of silently dreading the eventuality, it finally happened. A sputter and a few heart-stopping whines later and the generator finally broke in a rather boring spectacle. Our engineers think they can replace much of the damaged parts, but the chance of the generator breaking down once more seems almost likely - when, rather than if."
 random_event_bad.8.a: "Thats not good"

 random_event_bad.9.t: "Rail Derailment"
 random_event_bad.9.d: "Distressing news come from our borderlands, where a rail caravan was derailed in a tunnel by resistance groups opposing our occupation of their territory. Allegedly anyways, according to the nearby sorties on watch. In addition to the awaited equipment not making it to the front line, the underground railway in that tunnel now needs to be restored."
 random_event_bad.9.a: "Thats not good"

 random_event_bad.10.t: "Sentries attacked!"
 random_event_bad.10.d: "Not far from the front line a gruesome attack was perpetrated by enemies of our occupation. Upon our investigation, we discovered bloodied corpses of our soldiers with their equipment and weaponry taken away together with the now looted ammunition storage. Perpetrators of this despicable attack are guerilla warriors of one of the largest resistance cells in our conquered territory."
 random_event_bad.10.a: "Damn you bastards!"

 random_event_bad.11.t: "Corruption scandal"
 random_event_bad.11.d: "One of our statesmen has engaged in harmful activity that threatens the stability and lawfulness of our state. Appearently, he is responsible for the disappearance of a portion of our accumulated from tax-money national budget. Although he denied responsibility for this treasonous act, me must act swiftly if we want to look good in our public's eyes."
 random_event_bad.11.a: "This is unacceptable. Dismiss this man already!"
 random_event_bad.11.b: "This never happened..."

 random_event_bad.12.t: "A tarnish to our image"
 random_event_bad.12.d: "Recently a councillor in our government caused a brawl between him and his political opponent in front of a bar in our capital station. The chaos was ceased due to a quick reaction of our station guards, who noticed that both men have been under the influence of alcohol. Everything was seen by many passers-by and heavily criticised in the press. Our head speaker of the council publicly apologised already, but the two men still need to be dealt with. Our most experienced statesmen in ethics and discipline decided to..."

 random_event_bad.12.b: "Exclude those officials for a month"

 random_event_bad_protests.1.d: "You step outside your tent to greet a gathering throng of disgruntled citizens marching up and down the platform and poorly attempting to chant together in unison. A station guard carefully slips to your side, his rifle clutched tightly to his sternum. He explains to you rising disgruntlement over how the administration has been running things has spurred more than just lingering resentment brought into protests. Something about a worker being short-changed here, half rations there and soon enough people got fed up enough to demonstrate their anger and frustration.\n\n They plan on protesting for the forseeable future. Any way they can. And with passing gossip from traders this little stunt might run the risk of growing to other stations. The situation hasn't yet turned violent. Though, the guard cracks a wicked smile as he faces you. It'd not be difficult to put down. If it ever comes to that."
 random_event_bad_protests.1.a: "Send in the boys to whip them back to work."
 random_event_bad_protests.1.a.tt: "This may have dire reprecussions!"
 random_event_bad_protests.1.b: "Ignore them, let them have their 5 minutes playing revolutionaries"
 random_event_bad_protests.1.c: "Confront the ring leaders, and personally address their concerns"
 random_event_bad_protests.1.c.tt: "You'll meet the crowds, and if reasonable, meet their concerns. Or atleast fickle your way through making them fuck off back to their shifts."

 random_event_bad_protests.2.t: "Civilians continue with the Strike"
 random_event_bad_protests.2.d: "undisturbed by your actions, the protests continue staunchly on. Whether the followers truly understand the revolutionary spirit or protest or are just looking for a quick chance skive off from their expected shifts is unknown. The protests are here to stay. For a while atleast, until the ringleaders start fighting amongst one another and people get bored."
 random_event_bad_protests.2.a: "Damn"
 random_event_bad_protests.2.a.tt: "The protest continues on"

 random_event_bad_protests.3.t: "General Strikes diminish"
 random_event_bad_protests.3.d: "Whether words of coming down hard on the strikers, or the protesters themselves decidedly got bored playing mock revolutionaries, the general strikes seem to be diminishing. Once the station platform was choked full of every man, woman and child chanting and standing idle, now lays dormant. Good. Perhaps now you'll get some peace and quiet from the confines of your tent from their horrible attempts at chanting."

 random_event_good.1.d: "A group of individuals have approached our Station entrance. Battle hardened from constant conflict within the metro. They seek solace within our Station and a place to settle down. In return they offer to serve our administration"
 random_event_good.1.a: "Welcome in"

 random_event_good.2.t: "The good Stuff"
 random_event_good.2.d: "One of our sentry guards returned elated with his discovery.\nWhilst at the tail-end of exchanging patrol duties with the next group of guardsmen, like some miracle, coming across several small dusty old crates. Peeking inside the man discovered inside dozens of bottles of vodka and other assorted alcohol. Whether dropped by some caravan, or bandit or what else. Sampling its content right there on the spot, the man took what he could. Saving some of the bottles for himself. Donating the rest to our administration as a gesture of goodwill, or a ploy as to get himself off of guard duty. Its ours for the taking!"

 random_event_good.4.t: "An extraordinary break-in"
 random_event_good.4.d: "In recent days our boys have found a locked room in the middle of a long, gloomy tunnel. The doors were heavier than a homie that had just passed out from drinking way too much moonshine, and now you must carry him home, so he will not die from those pesky muties. Any attempt to open the damn door was unsuccessful, as something was blocking it from the other side. The boys gave up, until another of our men found a pack of explosives that blasted the entrance open. What they found in the room was a big steel box with a pile of those modern firearms that are super rare in the metro."
 random_event_good.4.a: "Good News"

 random_event_good.5.t: "Eureka!"
 random_event_good.5.d: "Our most talented innovators have recently made a stunning technological breakthrough in our research. Certainly, their brilliance will make our most important fields of research more comprehensible."

### MILITARY

random_event_military.1.t: "No Harm no Foul"
random_event_military.1.d: "As you sit amongst your men around an open fire, a discussion across the flames starts to get a little to loud. A trivial discussion one moment broke into petulant insults the next as the commander gets up onto his feet. Kicking off into a fist fight between one of the off-duty sentries. Each punch and riposte shove landed with cracking ferocity. Surely not even Librarians could withstand such punishment, but you're witnessing two fellers doing just that. You order the two to break up the fight.\nYou watch as the two men peculiarly shake hands and clap one another on the shoulder, each congratulating the other on how nasty their hand work was."
random_event_military.1.a: "Thats one way to pass the time"

random_event_military.2.t: "Stroke of Genius"
random_event_military.2.d: "Your soldiers may be some of the dumbest individuals you have ever met. How can humanity have a chance to recover with these knuckle-scrapers running around playing pretend soldier? However for a brief moment, it does appear that your commander has gotten through their thick skulls and teaches them a thing or two about critical thinking."
random_event_military.2.a: "We'll make soldiers of them yet"

random_event_military.3.t: "Of Sound Soul"
random_event_military.3.d: "The soldiers are gathered around a campfire enjoying rest and a warm meal when the commander stands up. Given that the rest of the soldiers are sitting, he seems to have taken the floor and uses his newfound privilege. The commander seemingly spurs into a incoherent ramble about how if men were to be fearful of mutants then men would be similar to mutants. Further spiralling into exclaiming that they were the ones with homes and fire and families, and attempted to compare their situation to those of cavement. Whilst the bizarre outburst appeared to do very little to rouse an applauding cheer as he had hoped, a few of the soldiers raise their hands and simply grin."
random_event_military.3.a: "That atleast did something"

random_event_military.4.t: "Growing a Spine?"
random_event_military.4.d: "Can you grow a Spine? Some our soldiers think you can. Arguments weave back and forth around a campfire as the stationed guard spit and swear from distant memories of biology class that bones could infact grow. The disagreement reaches a boiling point, as the commander; seemingly finding himself staunchly opposed to the idea of being able to re-grow bone matter stands upright. As if to elaborate his point the commander calls forth a pigs carcass from cold storage, splaying it out infront for the soldiers to gleam at. With a knife, the commander begins to tail along the chunks of cartilage and sinew still clinging against the bony protrusions of the pigs backside. Whatever science class the commander was trying to show to his audience quickly devolved into wisecracks and banter like schoolchildren as the commander ripped apart the cacass, illustrating his point over bone anatomy."
random_event_military.4.a: "He finally got over it"

random_event_military.5.t: "Clarity of Mind"
random_event_military.5.d: "One of your commanders is walking up and down the station platform with his hand out and his fingers stretched as if he were balancing across a tightrope. He nodes to himself as he turnes around, one foot placed infront of each foot. Marching his way across. Encountering the commander, he offers an explanation to his act. It seems as though he feels alright, and whatever had ailed the commander had seemingly disappeared. Perhaps he had found a dotting woman from the station, or something more entirely?"
random_event_military.5.a: "Good on him"

random_event_military.6.t: "Paranoid"
random_event_military.6.d: "A lone soldier enters your tent with his hands crossed firm and tapping softly against his uniform as if he was plucking streams of fibre out from it. Even though you haven't said a word the man's head nods furiously and his eyes jet around the place as if looking for words to say.\n\nYou ask him what the issue is. As his eyes twitch he nods again and begins to explain. The words come fast, but he explains the general gist of it. As he and his sorties were making their routine forrays in the tunnels they approached an old maintenance shaft branching out from the main tunnel. Beyond the tangled webs and knotted groves of mutated plants some of the soldiers swores they saw an overwhelmingly large figure peering from beyond blanket of darkness. Unperturbed by the silly fears the commander went forth to investigate with his rifle loaded. 2, 3, four hours went and as the soldiers decided to mount a forray to find the commander from the murky darkness the command emerged. Changed. No sounds of gunshots were heard and yet his rifle remained empty. Whatever happened, the commander has refused to comment. Seemingly to have changed from the encounter."
random_event_military.6.a: "Thats not good"

random_event_military.7.t: "Fainthearted"
random_event_military.7.d: "A soldier approaches you with a pained look on his face. His helmet in his hands as he wipes his brow. His voice crackles as he attempts to explain the unfolding situation. Although the soldier eruopts into incoherent battles, judging by the look on his face he is disturbed.\n\nThe Soldier leads you to a throng of guards huddled around something or someone. Breaking your way through the crowd the company quiets down as you come into the clearing to find a body unconscious on the ground.\n\nA.. Man? No? A mutant? The image was impossible to describe. His skin transluscent and sickly with the faint amount of light peering through to illuminate the persons blackened organs beneath his boney ribcage. Tracts of red marks run across the things shoulder and thick crust of skin hangs like tumours around the underside of his arms and abdomen. It is dead. Blood leaking out a wound on its temple. Shaking your head your order the men to clean up and dump the body, asking for where the person who shot the mutant to come forward. An eerie silence falls across the crowd, as the prolongued quietness is punctured by a lowly voice eminating from the back. The commander on duty had been first approached by the mutant, who subsequently shot him. The commander had fled from horror, and was last seen throwing up his guts over the sight of the creature in the back end of the station. Truly, the commander had believed the mutant to infact be human, and the sight of the creature truly sickened him to the core."
random_event_military.7.a: "He'll get over it, won't he?"

random_event_military.8.t: "Commander becomes Irrational"
random_event_military.8.d: "A commander enters your tent a few hours after station lockdown. Wide-eyed and sweating profusely he absentmindedly shrinks from the glow of the kerosene lamp besides your desk. You ask him what the problem and he begins to babble. It takes some parsing of his words to understand but it sounds as though he had awoken hearing petrified screams. Telling you these screams have awoken him for the 3rd time this month, and whilst the first time he believed to have been a prank. The 2nd and 3rd have only worsened his state of mind."
random_event_military.8.a: "Stupid commander"

random_event_military.9.t: "Cruelty"
random_event_military.9.d: "You step outside your tent and quietly survey the stationed men. A great many of them freshly hired grunts from the station population, nervously buddying up with one another or trying their hand at some simple exercises. A sad, unfortunate sight to behold. But the crowd halts when the action commander lurches forwards from posted to a defensive barricade on one side. With a booming cry, the soldiers rise and fall into rank and file on command. As he barks orders to the green soldiers, one by one they fall back receed into active duty. A retired Stalker cackles as he observes, as he waves his crutch across the tiled flooring as he hobbles to your side. Explaining the situation, he relays the commander had seemingly uncovered a side to his personality that even he didn't know was there. Drilling and inspiring unrelenting fear in the hearts of the recruits. Even the more experienced soldiers seemingly put off by the sudden change in the commanders demeanour, who are seemingly naught to be found mulling about the campfires or empty bar seats as per usual."
random_event_military.9.a: "Wouldn't want to be on his bad side"

random_event_military.10.t: "Injury Accident"
random_event_military.10.d: "Whilst our commander is relegated to command duties, it does not mean they cannot enter the fray in line with their soldiers. Or train alongside them, for that matter. Our commander is adamant in training alongside his troops. Lecturing his soldiers on how to properly train whilst at the same time not watching where he is going. A wayward pile of debri crosses path with his feet and a moment later the commander stumbles over onconscious.\n\nThe commanders attempt at teaching his soldiers had failed, however one piece of information posthumorously inbued amongst his compatriots is to atleast look down and watch their step."
random_event_military.10.a: "Atleast he didn't snap his spine"

random_event_military.11.t: "Commander becomes Fearless"
random_event_military.11.d: "You come across one of your commanders, sitting amongst his squadmates surrounding an open fire. The mens discussions meander from previous confrontations battling mutants to rather more lighthearted conversations over a warm meal. The chit-chat drifts as seamlessly as the fire crackles, but eventually leans back into solemnity when the commander begins to discuss about his fears. Explaining that he is fearful of a painfull death, or carelessly throwing his life away. He has seen many men die, most recklessly but some ultimately for naught. An eerie quiet falls upon the campfire in the moment, before the soldiers begin to pep up the rather skittish commander. Explaining there is nothing to fear.\n\nThe soldiers exchange back and forth their seemingly trivial worries, but eventually the conversation drifts back into humor."
random_event_military.11.a: "Good on him..."

random_event_military.12.t: "Loyalty"
random_event_military.12.d: "You approach one of your commanders, sat on a rickety stool overlooking the stations perimeter defenses. Amongst him stand his squadmates and comrades in arms as the chat amongst themselves. Noticing your presence, the group falls to a terse silence as if impatiently awaiting for you to dispell the silence. As the commander leans off from his rickety chair and stands upright the atmosphere amongst the soldiers return to normal, almost ignoring your presense as their commander greets you.\n\nTaking you to one side, the commander explains to you that for a long while things around the station didn't look too great. Even at one point overhearing the idea of desertion amongst his soldiers who had previously planned on fleeing to some neighbouring station. However with your recent actions promoting a strong change in the hears and outlooks on the soldiers he is appreciated of. Knowing nothing about taxes or settling labour disputes, the commander acknowledges the noticable improvement of things."
random_event_military.12.a: "Good"

## Bandit ##

random_event_military_bandit.1.t: "The Stunt"
random_event_military_bandit.1.d: "Something of a commotion draws you from your tent. Men are crowded behind a burn barrel not far from the station platform, eagerly watching something in the distance. Squnting your vision, you notice one of your commanders and one of the newly hired Gopniks doing something odd. A tin can is perched atop the mans head. Whilst the other is taking gradual steps away, gun in his hand.\n\nAsking your right hand man what is going on, he explains that the two men are going to try some sort of stunt that involves shooting the can off from the mans head. Shocked, you exclaim thats not safe at all, to which the brother grins and explains that is the point."
random_event_military_bandit.1.a: "This might actually be interesting..."
random_event_military_bandit.1.b: "Stop them At Once!"

random_event_military_bandit.2.t: "The Stunt"
random_event_military_bandit.2.d: "The bratok cheer as you give the affirming nod. Taking a seat amongst them as the commander gets ready to take the shot as the gopnik balances the tin can atop his head. When the tin is ready the commander draws back his handgun, narrowing his gaze as he gazes down the barrel. The rest of the brigands exchange bets and speculate wildly on whether or not he misses. Some averting their gaze only momentarily, but the spectacle is truly too much.\n\nA great gasp follows the sound of lead firing. Men reel back in their seats, wincing and gritting their teeth. The tin can erupts, and debris sprinkles across the floor. After the brief silence the crowd erupts into cheers which the commander hails, the lowly Gopnik slackens his posture and looks relieved."
random_event_military_bandit.2.a: "Nailed It!"

random_event_military_bandit.3.t: "The Stunt"
random_event_military_bandit.3.d: "You mull the unfolding situation. Twice, thrice over. The Bratok all look towards you, expecting you to stop the unfolding situation, yet instead you decide to take a seat amongst them. This spurs a brief cheer amongst the crowd which quickly dies down to a hush whisper as the commander, and the Gopnik get ready.\n\n\n''Make sure to hit the can!'' One thug shouts. Laughter ripples and dies as quickly as it erupts. Laughter repeats again in nervous anticipation. The sound of lead discharging dispells the tense crowd into silence. Followed by an abrupt THUD as the bratok crumples into the floor."
random_event_military_bandit.3.a: "You stupid fool"


### Cirucs ##

random_event_circus.01.t: "Traveling Performers"
random_event_circus.01.d: "A colorful rail car trundles up on your station entrance with a sort of clanking, jingling musical immodesty. You didn't think it a particularly big cart, but about fifteen men and women inexplicably pour out from its back. Painted faces, musical instruments, juggling balls, the troupe of enterainers fan out and demonstrate mini-talent shows as though you'd already paid for their services. When they finish, they claop, stomp their feet and freeze before you, hands out, smiles across their face. A white-faced mime ironically speaks\n\nWhat says you, care for a show? A mere 100 bullets to entertain you all evening!"
random_event_circus.01.a: "Pay for a show, perhaps it will be good."
random_event_circus.01.b: "Tell them to shoo"
random_event_circus.01.c: "How about you hand us over your valuables?"

random_event_circus.02.t: "Traveling Performers"
random_event_circus.02.d: "You pay for a show which the troupe puts on quite well. The jesters crack jokes, jugglers juggle which seem somewhat old hat, especially as their balls threaten to send the whole station ceiling crashing down on the performers; perhaps an unintended spot for laughs amongst the watchers, and the mime; well, godawful, almost boring the crowd to tears.\n\nWhen its all said and done, you do feel like you atleast got your money's worth and the crowds seem to be content."
random_event_circus.02.a: "Thanks"

random_event_circus.03.t: "Traveling Performers"
random_event_circus.03.d: "Before the troup can start, one of the station administrators gets up and asks if they know a particular song from his days in the military. They used to sing it when he was little lad. It had been years since he had heard it and only only hum the melody to the troupe. The mime, again breaking character grins loudly and proclaims to them that he knew it by heart. Snapping his fingers, the musicians of the group pick up their instruments. When they start, the tine is instantly catchy. Its stringent, and melody instantly catches along amongst the crowd. Perhaps even far Sevastopol or Exhibition station could listen if their coned their ears close enough.\n\nAfter the troupe finishes, you ask how much you owe them. The mime shaks his head, commenting how payment wasn't necessary and it had as a matter of fact been an honor to play the request."
random_event_circus.03.a: "Good show"

random_event_circus.04.t: "Traveling Performers"
random_event_circus.04.d: "You order the caravan to be raided. Whilst a few of the performers jokingly play along in character at first, their playful expressions are quickly wiped as one of your soldiers walks up and plants a punch right on one of the performers chins. The performer flops down with a catlike shriek, mewling in the dirt as he clutches his jaw.\n\nThe rest of the squad knocks the troupe around whilst raiding their caravan for any valuables. A juggler gets kicked right in the balls, and a singer gets throttled to the ground by another soldier.\n\nWhen its all said and done, there really wasn't much to take; who would have known beating up jesters and jugglers was the most profitable business? At least with a busted jaw the mime will do his job better."
random_event_circus.04.a: "Learn to play an instrument, idiot"
