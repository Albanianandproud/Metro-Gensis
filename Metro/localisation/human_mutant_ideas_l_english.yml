 molodezhnaya_desc:0 "A society of mutated people. Deformed due to the shallow depth of the station they took refuge in, radiation seeped into the station, killing of many of its inhabitants. Those who did survive however, were horribly mutated and deformed. Not welcomed by any other station, these poor souls face persecution outside of their home station.\n\nRelatively isolated from the rest of the Metro. The citizens of Molodezhnaya have found relative security. With their inhabitants over time able to develope unique psychic and telepathic abilities. Even able to sustain and endure the harsh radiation.\n\nDespite the deformities they endure, their station remains one of the most clean, organized and hospitable and generally pleasant societies outside of the Grand Metro. With their inhabitants still retaining much of their humanity even compared to 'unmutant' stations."
