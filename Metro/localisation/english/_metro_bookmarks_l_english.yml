 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Genesis"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "It has been 15 years since the day of Armageddon. On that fateful day humanity drew its last breath and casted itself into extinction. With the remnants taking refuge within the dark and dingy tunnels and systems which comprise the Moscow Metro. Cultivating its own law and governance within each station. While safe from the nuclear obliteration on the surface, the constant state of perpetual war, mutant infestations and now reports of an insidious menace stirring within the decrepit dakrness. Does Humanity have any hope of survival?"

 RED_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "A haven for Soviet nostalgia, and occupying much of the Sokolnicheskaya Line. Preaching the values of equality and common ownership, the Red Line possesses the largest population and greatest territory in the Metro. A true upholder of Russias magnificent Socialist Past. Yet internally it is a bastardised mockery of repression and censorship. Pouring all it could muster in the fruitless Hansa-Redline War and personally taking the burden of that conflict. The scars have yet to heal, and won't be forgotten anytime soon."

 RCH_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "§RRussia for the Russians!§! Occupying the 3 stations of Tverskaya, Chekhovskaya, and Pushkinskaya exists the Reich; A homogenous, neo-nazi organisation formed from the remnants of pre-war far right groups; Who turnt to the grim history of the past as a means to endure the present. Proclaiming themselves as the successors to Hitlers 3rd Reich. Taking it on themselves to purge the Metro from all mutants and vile filth. Reclusive, and repulsed by the denizens of the Metro. They are willing to die to secure their Thousand Year Reich."
 
 MSU_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Nestled outside beyond the bounds of the Metro, is the Mythic Emerald City. Believed to be a cradle of old-world scientific knowledge and culture; far rivaling and exceeds anything of the likes from Polis. A bastion of peace and harmony in an otherwise ignorant and oblivious world. However what is truly known of their existance is little more than half-truths, incomplete rumours and tall tales from the bottom of a flask of liquor.\n\nBut just like the childrens book its name is derived from; its grandiose stature a mere fairy tale. A tenuous tale which is bound to crack."
 
 HNZ_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Hanza is a Capitalist Alliance of independant stations, which has completely subjugated the Ring Line, and boasts huge political and economic clout within the Metro. Peacefully trading with many neutral stations.\n However this almighty status would have not been without conflict; The bloody and ruthless Hanza-Redline War in the 2020s, paying the bloodprice personally for the war. While peace was achieved, it did little to quell the flames, with tensions slowly, but surely stirring all across the Metro. A major conflict will come. With Hanza being at its epicenter. Whether they like to or not."
 
 PLS_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Where the spark of humanity has not snuffed out, and where people live like people. Polis is a young-state, rising from the blood-bath of the Hanza-Redline Conflict. Keeping alive the traditions and knowledge of the old world. Habouring scientific knowledge not seen anywhere else in the Metro. Sitting right in the middle of 2 burgeoning superpowers it has chosen to remain neutral. But for how long can Polis remain so?"

 SPT_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "An elite force of battle-hardened warriors belonging to no ideology or nation and only serve the presevation of humanity. The Spartans are the most skilled and deadliest warriors in the whole metro. With many members serving in Russian Special Forces before the war. They maintain a close relationship with Polis and its defense. They keep a neutral stance towards the bigger factions of the Metro. But with the gears of war beging to clank and churn once more; for how long can they remain idle for?"

 ARB_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Once having substantial power and a sizable population, the Arbat Confederation is little more than a vassal state to Hanza. Severely weakened during the Hanza-Redline conflict. Now with an unseen threat lingering in the shadows, its population stired up and fleeing the station."

 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Almost two-decades have cultivated various communities. All with their own seperate identities. Engaging in trade, diplomacy and warring amongst one another. Many of whom by and large are ignored by the bigger political turmoil. Only sharing one thing in common; survival. Struggling to meet ends in this decaying world."
 
 BAU_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "An Alliance of stations on the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line who prioritise in retrofitting and repairing pre-war technology. Relatively able to stay afloat and wealthy from their interactions with the rest of the metro. But with stirring threats and Hansa mobilising. How long can the Alliance sustain their neutrality?"

 GWC_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Anti-technological cannibals skulking in the dark recesses of the metro. Emboldened by their mysterious leader. Skin-drums beat, and bone clubs snare, the world as we know it will be bathed in the fires of once before for humanities ingorance."

 KAL_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "A confederation of peaceful cooperating stations on the Kalininsko-Solntsevskaya line. A rather tranquil working community ruled by a overseeing council. With no threats of mutants, and only a few outright dangerous anomalies."

 TRT_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Nicknamed after a city of ages past. Most of the three stations have been flooded, and the inhabitants occupy structures built upon stilts. No particular community or political group stakes a claim here. It is a city of sin, dreams and freedom. Organized crime hustles for control in plain sight. If they were to unite, and pull together their organizations. They could prove to be an unmatchable force..."

 ULI_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "A left-leaning community occupying the northwestern section of the Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya line. It is becoming increasingly poor from economic decline, internal strife and mutant attacks. With Hanza closing in to swallow them hole, the confederation needs to stand firm strong one-by-one, or be blown away by the coming storm."

 SEV_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "A station of Engineers, but most predominantly soldiers. Every citizen trained to fight the mutants who skulk from the southern tunnels. It is an important station which provides power to most if not all of the Southern Metro."

 VDN_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "A peaceful trading community reknowned for their mushroom tea. Able to live quite comfortably through trade with its neighbours and partners from afar. Hosuing its own public library and with high rates of literacy."

 BRK_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "A collection of free farms and factories. Who are the 'breadbasket' of the Metro. Selling mushrooms, pigs and wheat which the communities stalkers discovered."
