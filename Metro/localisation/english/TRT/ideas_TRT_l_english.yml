 TRT_mere_thugs_desc:0 "Whilst on the outside, Venice seems like a unified community. Its just a mere collection of bandits, and common folk. The maintenance of an otherwise united group is just an illusion. Structure and daily life is completely different from each of the stations in the bandit triangle."

 TRT_city_on_stilts_desc:0 "Like the Italian city which Venice recieves its name from, is a settlement built upon stilts. The bandit triangle recently flooded the stations. Now the survivors have the long and arduous task of rebuilding their communities."

 TRT_bandit_enterprise_desc:0 "At the intersection of the Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya, Kalininskaya and Zamoskvoretskaya line exists Venice. An alliance of three otherwise independent stations. A population of otherwise boring, sullen folk, but under the ruthless reign of criminals and smugglers. A haven of scum and villany."
