HNZ_new_quater_desc:0 "3 years has passed since the peace treaty was signed by the Arbat, Polis and the Red Line, birthing what we now know as the Commonwealth of the Ring Line. In that short time the Commonwealth has grown to become the most wealthiest - and influential station-states in the entire Metro"

HNZ_economic_neutrality:0 "Economic Neutrality"
HNZ_economic_neutrality_desc:0 "With great power comes responsibility - The Hanseatic League holds the most powerful position in the entire metro, that being the Ring Line. Staying oblivious to the petty conflicts that go on between independent stations is a much more economically viable option. Besides, the Horrors of the Anti-Communist war has yet to be forgotten - best yet not to replicate another horrific conflict."

HNZ_guiding_hand:0 "Guiding Hand of the Market"
HNZ_guiding_hand_desc:0 "The 'Guiding' or 'Invisible' Hand, coined by Scottish economist, Adam Smith, refers to self-regulating aspect of the free-market. Instead of government regulation of the market itself, and allowing the market along to its own interests. The market would therefor be guided by independent traders as if by an invisible hand."

HNZ_passport_requirements_desc:0 "A myriad of trade caravans pass through our numerous stations many times a day. From far flung stations to the far hinterlands where the notion of humanity has been forgotten; The Hansa recieves numerous peoples passing through a day. The free-access of peoples could leave stations vulnerable to subversive activities or even sabotage. Documentation or a Passport of each passing individual will keep tabs on any potential wicked characters which may seek to do harm to the Commonwealth."

HNZ_adam_smith_legacy:0 "Adam Smith's Legacy"
HNZ_adam_smith_legacy_desc:0 "A Scottish economist and philosopher who pioneered in early political-economic thought. His concepts birthed the concept of the free-market and allowing the freedom for every individual to produce and echange goods as they saw fit.

HNZ_establish_war_committee:0 "Establish The War Committee"
HNZ_establish_war_committee_desc:0 "During the Hansa-Red Line war, a war committee was formed between anti-communist coalition forces to better organise and plan tactics against the Red Line. Thankfully we haven't had to muster a organisation of that capacity since then. However with the growing tension within the Metro, forming a Committee of Station chiefs, military personnel would be an ideal operation."

HNZ_general_grizzled_veteran:0 "Grizzled Veteran"
HNZ_general_grizzled_veteran_desc:0 "To This Council we could add Sergei Yasnov; an old man in his late 50s who had fought in many previous conflicts even before the Hansa-Redline War. The utter carnage he witnessed and endured during the war made him retire from active duty. But now he wishes to return back to the fold."

HNZ_grizzled_not_another_bloodbath_desc:0 "The Conflict was utter carnage. Bodies clogged the tunnels as men and boys alike were thrown into the meat grinder with a total lack of regard. Sergei was in the thick of the fray, and lost many of his battle brothers. Yasnov remains solemnly silent about his stories of the war. Indeed so as he wishes to avoid another attritional hellhole which was the war."

A very strategic stretch of tunnels considering the fact that anyone outside the radial ring of the metro must pass through to the inner Metro.
