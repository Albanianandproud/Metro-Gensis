 nf_RED.1.t:0 "Revolution"
 nf_RED.1.d:0 "Its no chance that the Red Line sprouted from the Sokolnicheskaya line. Every edifice and facade of the line finely detailed with statues of Stalin and Lenin. Monuments of once-revered saints lay as a surviving testament to the world before. Like Egyptian Tombs, its ephemeral aura of power drew in those far and wide; pilgrims to witness what was. Over a period of time awe became reverence, and finally devotion. With the world as we knew gone, and only those faded memories of the past existed. It gave hope; an opportunity to build a new socialist bastion, unshackled from the burdens of the past.\n\n Surving Komsomol figures and those who lived under the reign of socialism began to put in motion a socialist revival. Overthrowing local stations and installing revolutionary councils across the Sokolnicheskaya, declaring a first Interstational; their goal, uniting the entire metro under Communism. Andrey Moskvin was one such revolutionary, his robustness and vigour personally spearheading the revolution and soon found himself overseeing the newly-established revolution."

 nf_RED.1.b:0 "Andrey  Moskvin became a symbol of the revolution"

 nf_RED.2.t:0 "Fallout"
 nf_RED.2.d:0 "However, what first began as social upheaval became a full-scale war with the rest of the metro. Many stations opposed the desires of the newly-established Red Line. Those on an ideological basis. Capitalist stations and others opposed to the workers revolution. The forming station-state of the Hanseatic League, diametrically opposed the Red Line, leading a coalition of stations to fight against the Red Line. Thusly started one of the bloodiest conflicts in the entire metro. Bodies plunged into the meat grinder, and precious rescourse churned for the war effort. A stalemate of attritional warfare, with neither side yielding, but becoming weaker as the war elapsed. As the realisation that the dream of a united Metro under socialism was fading, unrest and mutinies began to arise from within. Ideological differences spurred on full-scale insurrection, those leaving the fight and establishing their own stations, weakening the Red Lines support for the war in the process."
 nf_RED.2.a:0 "Their ideals grew too ambitious"
 nf_RED.2.b:0 "Our ideals shrank as the war waged on"

 nf_RED.3.t:0 "Peace"
 nf_RED.3.d:0 "As the war dragged on furtherm neither the Red Line, or the Hanza saw the possibility of victory against the other. Pouring every resource they could scrap to kill, maim and destroy the other side with the end result being the innevitable decay of both parties. As both nations began to crumble and rot from the inside from exhaustion. citizens and soldiers alike protesting against the war. Too arrogant to kneel to the mob, either side were unyielding to submit to a peace agreement incase of the deal making one side appear weak. Stubborn to proclaim a victory. Eventually however, peace was arranged in absolute secret. Andrey knew the war could never be won against the Coalition, however it was not his decision, however it was his brother.\n\n His Younger brother, Maxim Moskvin, who oversaw the peace talks, at first without Andrey's knowledge. The deal commenced; Ploshchad Revolyutsii was to be given to the Red Line from Arbat. Arbat received the Biblioteka Imeni Lenina with eventually was handed over to Polis. A guarentee of free-access was agreed upon by all parties. The Red Line was cut in half. Andrey was championed by the people and the party alike for the peace. The inner circle of 'hard-blooded' socialists scorn at what they deemed a 'betrayal' of the revolution. Whilst unknowing that it was Andrey's own brother Maxim being the true negotiator of peace. A starting point which planted his brothers growing resentment towards him."

 nf_RED.3.b:0 "Andrey was Championed by the party"

 nf_RED.4.t:0 "State of the Line"
 nf_RED.4.d:0 "Andrey, a member of the revolutionary council, now saw himself as the General Secretary of the Red Line. Despite there being other competitors to that mantle, his will and tenacity saw him take to the mantle of leadership. His rule soon became unquestioned. Now in 2028 as the ashes of the Hanseatic Redline conflict begin to settle. The Red Line finds itself ever increasingly sliding into a more dire situation. The Sokolnicheskaya finds itself ina  precarious position which must be adressed with delicate hands. Many issues plague the nation, more within than without. The economy has grown stagnant, a policy of confiscation of resources levied for our military is still practised, making our economy unable to grow and develop from a subsistence basis. Neglect over the governments willingness to handle this, spurred on by the military's bloated control over all facets of business and daily industry has spiraled into the commonfolk slowly detesting the local powers which be. Even with hushed whispers against the state itself. These issues have only grown and festered in recent months.\n\n This is not the only problems to face us however. The Fascists pigs of Tverskaya have recently become invigorated thanks to their new Fuhrer. Scuffles on the tunnels between us has only increased from sporadic conflicts within recent weeks. Like the Great Patriotic War of old, we once fought and defeated them like. But it took a great deal of sacrifice. A monumental effort of blood and iron. Something way may not be able to affort right now.\n\n We are the heirs of the Soviet Socialist Union. Lenin's will will not snuffed out!"

 nf_RED.5.t:0 "Question of Economy"
 nf_RED.5.d:0 "Our economy has quite simply, reached a slump. Despite our best efforts to reform and rehabilitate the economy which has proven to be inefficient. Most resources which haven't been allocated to the Military, or distributed to our R&D is used to resuscitate our stagnant economy. A more direct approach is needed; instead of resources being spent to just 'patch up' the bloating issue, a new method is needed.\n\n Two solutions have been proposed. Firstly is the implementation of Grants and other social schemes aiming to improve individual station adimistrations' at handling local issues, giving them the resources needed. Secondly a more fundamental solution is prioritising funds aimed at growing our primary industries such as construction and farming. Being able to be self sufficient and support itself and future growth."

 nf_RED.8.d:0 "Maxim Moskvin, Andreys younger brother. Always in his shadow and always with a chip upon his shoulder. Maxim had always been jealous of his older brother. Andreys charm, his success and power. A brotherly relationship rotted and no more than simple rivalry.\n\n Was there any respect Maxim held for his older brother? Hard to tell, but that love had been weathered and had withered away over the years to nothing. The only memories Maxim could give of their youth wasn't the bond they once shared, careless children but the bitter resentment he held.\n\n Despite this, Moskvin holds to him his own talents. He may never be anything like is more talented brother. But Maxim holds to him a resolve that few could attain. A strong brow, and an unquestioned authority few could dare to go against. Self confidence and true to ones self. Arrogance? possibly, but someone to lead, a figurehead."
