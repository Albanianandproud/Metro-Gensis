  nf_PLS.6.t: "Castes of Polis"
  nf_PLS.6.d: "Just like Ancient India, the inhabitants of Polis are stratified upon a caste system. Hindu names for them among ourselves. Scientists are the Brahmins, the soldiers are the Kshatriyas, the merchants are the vaishyas, and menial labourers and engineers are the Shudras. People become members of a caste once and stay in that caste for the rest of there lives, with special rites of passage for Kshatriyas and Brahmins.\n\nThe Castes are represented by their respective ideology groupings. Maintaining a equal balance between a four castes, ensuring neither one has an unequal percentage of power within Polis will keep those castes in our favour."

  nf_PLS.10.t: "Divisions of Power"
  nf_PLS.10.d: "Power in polis is divided between two castes; the Brahmins (Scientists) and the Kshatriya (Soldiers). Those who collect books and preserve the last dwindling knowledge that humanity has to offer; and those who protect those books from the darkness of the night. The Council of Polis predominantly comprises of these two sects, who in turn take on the decision of steering Polis towards meaningful goals and seek solutions during troubling times.\n\nEnsuring a perfect balance between Brahmins and Kshatriya members upon the council lies in our best interest."

  nf_PLS.41.d: "It has been years since the Communist wars reach its conclusion, and in that time dissent has slowly stirred rearing itself to poke holes in the tenable peace which endures.

  nf_PLS.42.t: "Kshatriya: Establish Regional Command"

  nf_PLS.45.d: "Even as the fires of Armageddon smothered the land and sea, Mans faustian spirit endured. Philosophy aside, our Science base still persists conducting experiments and research almost as if WW3 did not happen. That is, until their research is halted. As of late, we've seen an unexpected slowdown in Research Efforts. Our Brahmin urge us to set aside more funding towards our Research base. Human Progress must continue; whatever the cost."

Trivial or otherwise."

  nf_PLS.52.t: "Shudra: Rail transportation"
  nf_PLS.52.d: "Try hauling several kilos on your back for a few days straight and see if you don't become a grumpy piece of shit. The Shudra are getting fed up with having to traverse across the Tunnels carrying arduous amounts of materials. Infact, they suggest we put our efforts into repairing some of the old carriages, and using those as mobile frieght transporters. We have numerous Draisines in stockpile.

  nf_PLS.56.d: "With recent turbulent times helping to accentuate the growing need to become self sufficient, now is the time to strive towards that goal.
