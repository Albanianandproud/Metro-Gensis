I hate bloodshed.. but for the sake of achieving high goals...''§!\n\nInheriting the tenacity and cunning of Ilyich himself, and following in the same footpath of a true Bolshevik revolutionary and bringing a renaisance of communist nostalgia to the Red Line and subsequently the Metro itself. Under his steady hand and cast-iron brow the flame of Communism ignited and saw to it Muscovites looked to the glory of Russias past to survive and endure the hardships of the present. Vigorously hailed by the proletariat; whether out of genuine love for his rule or politely obligated to by the barrel end of a rifle, Moskvin will ensure that until the last Muscovite draws breath, the staunch will of Lenin himself has yet to be snuffed."

Moskvin obscured to the shadows by his brothers natural charm and intellect, and most importantly of his success; Beloved and respected by the people of the §R Red Line§!. A mixture of both scorn and envy which has only festered in recent years. Despite this, Moskvin's knowledge in warfare, and past career has its uses.
