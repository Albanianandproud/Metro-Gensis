 nf_DMD.1.t:0 "Disaster in Orehovo"
 nf_DMD.1.d:0 "We don't know what happened exactly, but we heard a rumble and death screams from Orehovo. We immediately called reinforcements from Krasnogvardenskaya until we found out it is probably over. A big flood was coming from the tunnels of Orehovo which brought alot aquatic mutants to Domodedovskaya. We immediately started to evacuate women and children to Krasnogvardenskaya and defend from the incoming flood, however our situation seems unsustainable. What should we do?"
 nf_DMD.1.a:0 "Evacuate our stations immediately towards the surface, we must try to reach Pechatniki! (game will end for you)"
 nf_DMD.1.b:0 "We must hold Domodedovskaya, wait from the reinforcements from Krasnogvardenskaya!"
