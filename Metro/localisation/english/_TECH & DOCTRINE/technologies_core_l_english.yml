  squadron_1: "Coordinated Instructors"
  squadron_1_desc: "Anyone can hold and gun and be told to shoot. Our Armed forces vary wildly in tactics and in skills. From those with extensive pre-war knowledge to those who have lived their entire lives beneath peeling white-washed ceilings. Collectivizing the best of this knowledge so that it can put to good usage should be our first fundamental step into reforming our armed forces."
  squadron_2: "Force Rotation"
  squadron_2_desc: "We must remember as much as we hate the ravaging, feral mutant beast infront of us we hold our families and loved ones behind us with love. Our soldiers are not infallable machines. Fixed rotation times between the front, reserves and off-duty will undoubtedly rejuvinate our armed soldiers."  
  squadron_3: "Conscription Standards"
  squadron_3_desc: "We must pluck the most competent and able from our civilian population. While in times of need, everyone must heed the call. Crippled and the sick are exempt from the draft."
  squadron_4: "MYOG"
  squadron_4_desc: "MYOG - Simply known as 'Make Your Own Gear' is a specialized form of improvisation and repairing bits of kit and modifying existing equipment whilst out in the field. Guns jam, webbing fractures and helmets crack, our forces are as only as effective as the equipment they fiercly keep in good shape."  
  squadron_5: "Basic Survival Training"
  squadron_5_desc: "Whether deep within the intestinal bowels of the Metro, or upon the bitter frozen surface survival of our troops is the upmost priority."
  squadron_6: "Compulsory Drills"
  squadron_6_desc: "The individual skills and weaknesses of our army will be tested in the field. strength, stamina and endurance must be at its maximum potential in every one of our soldiers."  
  squadron_7: "Macro-operations"
  squadron_7_desc: "Employing a hands-off style of leadership allows our forces to make direct, more impactful decisions out in the field."
  squadron_8: "Irregular Warfare"
  squadron_8_desc: "Emphasizing small, independent forces to carry out small-scale skirmishes, making enemy resources gradually deplete and wither away after each combat engagement."  
  squadron_9: "Blowtorch and Corkscrew"
  squadron_9_desc: "Americans once used a system to flush out the entrenched japanese forces all across the pacific. Defences were obliterated by concentrated fire, whilst the defenders were routed out by lethal weaponry."
  squadron_10: "Maneuver warfare"
  squadron_10_desc: "Emphasizing movement, and quick thorough thinking and initiative to achieve a position of advantage will reduce the likelyhood of incurring casualty losses. Engaging in disrupting enemy forces through maneuvers, rather than engagements"  
  squadron_11: "Case-Method Training"
  squadron_11_desc: "Everyone knows of the great patriotic war, the trenches of verdun to the Napoleonic campaign into Russia. But what of recent engagements? Written, documented or even retold events of modern, underground engagements will give the ability for new recruits make sense of the ever changing landscape of Warfare."
  squadron_12: "War Has Changed"
  squadron_12_desc: "In the darkness and uncertainty of the future, war has become the routine. No longer about nations, religion or ethnicity. War, and its consumption of life has become a well-oiled machine."  
  squadron_13: "War Never Changes"
  squadron_13_desc: "From when humans carved the first rock and used it to bludegon the head of his brother, to the forging of the first iron point. From the rank and files of Napoleonic Europe to the chemical inferno dumped onto Indochina. Mans propensity to kill eachother is unmatched by any other living creature."

  commander_1: "Distinguished Command"
  commander_1_desc: "We cannot enlist any random yob from the station gutter to lead our troops. In the past leaders were recruited based on merits, strength or loyalty. We should ascribe these requirements."

  commander_3: "Military Jargon Training"
  commander_3_desc: "Training new prominent commanders on key command terminology seems evidently a no-brainer. Hand gestures, etiquette or simply how to salute the rank is the first step."
  commander_4: "Command Standardisation"
  commander_4_desc: "Selecting the best candidate to lead the soldiers below him cannot be overstated. Drawing the short straw and letting any Pavel or Igor hurl his men straight into the fray is recipe for disaster."
