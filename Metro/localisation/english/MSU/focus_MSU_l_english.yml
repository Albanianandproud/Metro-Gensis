  MSU_effort_1: "Nation of Science...?"
  MSU_effort_1_desc: "Beyond the pale waters beneath the wreckage of Sparrow Hills, the former remnants of Moscow University reside. Far, far removed from all activities of the Metro - their existence is still hotly debated. Until now"

  MSU_effort_2: "A Bridge on the river Moskva"
  MSU_effort_2_desc: "The only guarenteed passage into Moscow University is over the ramshackled ruins of Sparrow Hills that is now chiefly a stomping ground for Mutants - Guardians from the Metro, in a twisted sense. However their reliability to keep intruders of Emerald City at bay is a tenuous one at best... if they aren't the ones snooping around that is."

  MSU_effort_3: "Revitalized Sciences"
  MSU_effort_3_desc: "The Apocalypse could not falter Humanities fascination for the unknown. Netiher could it stem the progress. The Third World War serves as a new playground for scientific experiments and field tests. As a matter of fact, science has become unrestrained from consequences as a result."

  MSU_effort_5: "Aggressive Field Experimentation"
  MSU_effort_5_desc: "With several crucial advancements made in the field of resisting the adverse effects of raduation. Our Spec Ops gear can withstand more adverse radiation than previously considered."

  MSU_effort_6: "Reitteration in Design"
  MSU_effort_6_desc: "Several advances made in the composition of our Spec Ops equipment has made substantial improvements to their overall design. Whilst more experiments are still certainly needed to iron out many of the kinks in their aformentioned designs, they're more or less perfectly capable to be integrated as it stands right now into our Stalker Kits."

  MSU_effort_7: "Elite Stalkers"
  MSU_effort_7_desc: "You'd expect scientists not to be apt fighters. While this is certainy the case, our Stalkers throws a wrench into that notion entirely. Whilst our surface sortie efforts primarily consist on researching the various anomalies sprinkled across Moscow, a few suggest that we may recruit from our experienced stalkers."

  MSU_effort_4: "Military Engineering"
  MSU_effort_4_desc: "Salvaging, fixing, repairing and breaking apart old existing guns will be fine for the meantime, but eventually the amount of guns in stockpile will dry up. Its not like theres an untapped goldmine of guns laying in some armory or storehouse upon the surface just waiting for the day we uncover them, unless that day is indeed today."

  MSU_effort_8: "Machining Parts"
  MSU_effort_8_desc: "We may of found one stockpile of guns in pristine condition, but that chance is unlikely to come once again. Fabricating parts doesn't need to be a hassle, with a nation of scientists surely a few brainiacs can figure out a way to make the process less arduous."

  MSU_effort_9: "Artisinal Handiwork"
  MSU_effort_9_desc: "We may of found one stockpile of guns in pristine condition, but that chance is unlikely to come once again. We're not cavemen. We have technology, documents, a whole liteny of scientific knowledge to back up our technicians."

  MSU_effort_10: "Rail Gun"
  MSU_effort_10_desc: "Based upon pre-war designs. A novelty to most, and a disregarded piece of tat to anyone of actual concern. Several extensive modifications have been made to streamline energy cost whilst overall improving production."

  MSU_effort_11: "Strike Out!"
  MSU_effort_11_desc: "With [288.GetName] Now fully under our control it is time we reveal ourselves to the rest of the Metro. Our scientific reporting have thusly concluded, and deemed the rest of the Metro unfit."
