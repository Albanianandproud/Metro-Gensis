  nf_KTG_internal.1.t: "Of Sodom and Gomorrah"
  nf_KTG_internal.1.d: "Here upon the former station of Kitay-Gorod you will find anything and everything - From real meat, working guns, exotic wares and more depending on what and where you look for it. Half of the visitors to the station lose their goods attempting to play cards, and the other half cannot, because they were already robbed blind.\n\n'Power' within Kitay-Gorod is unsteadily shared between two prominent groups of bandits. One half lorded beneath a brotherhood of ethnic Slavs, and on the other side a brotherhood of caucasian Muslims.\nIn spite of the constant anarchy and danger, many merchant caravans of disreputable nature arrive in droves. Kitay gorod serving as an important business hub for tenebrous meetings all throughout the seedy underbelly of the Metro."
  nf_KTG_internal.1.a: "Babylon was a gold cup in the Lord’s hand…"
  nf_KTG_internal.2.t: "Blood on the Tracks"
  nf_KTG_internal.2.d: "Whilst anarchy and the rule of might rules supreme in Kitay-Gorod, there does exist an unequal peace. Perhaps more of a 'I rub your back, and don't forget to rub my back' approach to relations. Not always hostile, but not always friendly. Most of the time we usually keep to our side of the station and they stick to theirs, until recently.\n\nOur neighbors over on the other side of Kitay-Gorod, have started hitting our own caravans. Not full assaults, simple hit and run tactics; or outright blackmail or scaring them off from entering our station. Pilfering their wares sort of thing. One of our boys even claim they saw their emblem sprayed over ours in one of the maintenance shafts our guards routinely make their sotry.\n\nMore than anything, the lads are restless. They whisper that if we appear weak, every other bandit group from here to Exhibition will jump down our throats. It seems obvious they're looking for us to retaliate. However if we strike first, this will turn into a tunnel war."
  nf_KTG_internal.2.b: "A forceful approach is too costly. We can catch more flies with honey.."
  nf_KTG_internal.2.a: "Send word to our lads, we'll give them a message they wont forget."
  nf_KTG_internal.3.t: "[FROM.GetName] Seeks dialogue"
  nf_KTG_internal.3.d: "After untold months of tension between our two stations, envoys sent from [FROM.GetName] have arrived to our half of the station, hellbent on negotiating some sort of truce between us. Temporary however, it doesn't seem like they're seeking to make any sort of agreement permanent. For now, both stations will agree to allow merchant caravens come and go unimpeded regardless of affiliation, and will consequently no longer skin the other sides proverbial cows, so to speak. It wont buy us any favors with [FROM.GetName]. However a temporary agreement might be a good thing. For now."
  nf_KTG_internal.3.a: "We've got better things to contend with."
  nf_KTG_internal.4.t: "[FROM.GetName] Targets our Caravans"
  nf_KTG_internal.4.d: "That about does it. [FROM.GetName] have started hitting our affiliated caravans! Holding up our own fleets and stealing their wares. While we knew [From.GetName] had no sense of bandit honor, this is outrageous even for their standards! Even so called executing those who didn't surrender themselves, or put up resistance. If this is some method to enforce obedience and submission, this wont work!"
  nf_KTG_internal.4.a: "They'll pay for this."
  nf_KTG_internal.5.t: "The Burning Question"
  nf_KTG_internal.5.d: "Gathering the majority of our most loyal and trusty men; the scarred, the old and experienced, discussions on how to proceed regarding the neighboring criminals across from us. Some call for patience, and to take long, systematic approach of bleeding them dry. Others pound the table and demand immediate action. The younger lieutennants demand glory and blood.\n\nDebate courses and meanders between both sides until eventually silence fills the room.\n\nEnough.\n\n. Every capable fighter on hand gathered, every round counted. Barricades reinforced and targets drawn. When the first shots are fired, they wont stop until our banner hangs above theirs."
  nf_KTG_internal.5.a: "We go to the mattresses."
  nf_KTG_internal.6.t: "Dark Movements"
  nf_KTG_internal.6.d: "With the majority of our most loyal and trusty men gathered to discuss what to do with [From.GetName], it seemed cooler heads eventually prevailed. Or at the very least those with more distinction and respect spoke aloud.\n\nEveryone knew what open war would mean. Months of fighting, months of grueling war and wasting bullets, and for what? To become so weak to allow another bandit clique to roll in and mop up whats left. Gangs didn't fight for turf, but rather for fear..\n\nAnd Fear could be purchased.\n\nIf those on the other side were hungry, then hunger could be leveraged. If their soldiers were looking for ambition, then ambition could be bought. A magazine of bullets put in the right hands, a warm meal in anothers.. A gun in someone elses.\nAny loyalty, could be exchanged. For a price."
  nf_KTG_internal.6.a: "The Metro respects strength. It fears cunning more."
