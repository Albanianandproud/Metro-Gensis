  nf_PLS.5.t: "Cultural Aid"
  nf_PLS.5.d: "[PLS.GetName]. Many call it the last place on earth where Humans live just like before, but I don't see whats all the fuss is about. Who'd wanna live around eggheads and wimps anyways? Whether because they feel pity, or as a way to flex their such vast intellectual might they have bestowed our Administration with an assorted collection of books. Large boos, manuscripts, documents and all. Hoping they we'll disperse these reading materials amongst our population. I honestly doubt any of our citizenry can sit through Solzhenitsyn let alone read."

  nf_PLS.5.c: "Stick them on the bonfire"

Scientists are the Brahmins, the soldiers are the Kshatriyas, the merchants are the vaishyas, and menial labourers and engineers are the Shudras. People become members of a caste once and stay in that caste for the rest of there lives, with special rites of passage for Kshatriyas and Brahmins.\n\nThe Castes are represented by their respective ideology groupings. Maintaining a equal balance between a four castes, ensuring neither one has an unequal percentage of power within Polis will keep those castes in our favour."

  nf_PLS.7.t: "Polis seeks intergration"
  nf_PLS.7.d: "For quite some time now, [SPT.GetName] has operated with some degree of autonomy outside from Polis. Internal disputes and the inner politiking of Polis was often than not kept far removed from affecting our mission. However things have changed. Polis is requesting that we come back underneath the jurisdicition of Polis authority. This will include forfeiting some of our autonomy. If we don't this could leade to adverse relations between us."
  nf_PLS.7.a: "Polis is our priority"
  nf_PLS.7.b: "Sparta will not kowtow to any ideology or group but only to Humanity"

  nf_PLS.10.t: "Divisions of Power"
  nf_PLS.10.d: "Power in polis is divided between two castes; the Brahmins (Scientists) and the Kshatriya (Soldiers). Those who collect books and preserve the last dwindling knowledge that humanity has to offer; and those who protect those books from the darkness of the night. The Council of Polis predominantly comprises of these two sects, who in turn take on the decision of steering Polis towards meaningful goals and seek solutions during troubling times.\n\nEnsuring a perfect balance between Brahmins and Kshatriya members upon the council lies in our best interest."
  nf_PLS.10.a: "Good to know"

  PLS_council_mission: "§YCouncil Missions§! are §Ytimed decisions§! requiring certain parameters to complete. Completeing these timed decisions will give us §YPolitical Sway§! on the Council, in turn allowing us to steer the Council without reprecussion."

  nf_PLS.41.d: "It has been years since the Communist wars reach its conclusion, and in that time dissent has slowly stirred rearing itself to poke holes in the tenable peace which endures.

Establishing several more Armament workshops will sedate our forces for the meantime."

  nf_PLS.42.t: "Kshatriya: Establish Regional Command"

  nf_PLS.45.t: "Brahmin: Seeking Research Grants"
  nf_PLS.45.d: "Even as the fires of Armageddon smothered the land and sea, Mans faustian spirit endured. Philosophy aside, our Science base still persists conducting experiments and research almost as if WW3 did not happen. That is, until their research is halted. As of late, we've seen an unexpected slowdown in Research Efforts. Our Brahmin urge us to set aside more funding towards our Research base. Human Progress must continue; whatever the cost."

  nf_PLS.46.t: "Brahmin: Improve Society"
  nf_PLS.46.d: "We live in a society. A human society. However taking a stroll down [PLS.Capital.GetName] will make you think twice any Homo Sapien survived the Nuclear Holocaust.

  nf_PLS.47.t: "Brahmin: Scientific Advancements"
  nf_PLS.47.d: "The surface awaits, even despite being blasted with radiation, filled with mutants and poisoned by the taint of harsh weather.

Trivial or otherwise."

  nf_PLS.51.t: "Shudra: Research Basics"
  nf_PLS.51.d: "Making sure most folks have an actual bed, and a roof over their heads will go a long way in improving our relations with the Shudra. Often overlooked, overworked and overexposed to much of the nitty gritty of running a post-war state."

  nf_PLS.52.t: "Shudra: Rail transportation"
  nf_PLS.52.d: "Try hauling several kilos on your back for a few days straight and see if you don't become a grumpy piece of shit. The Shudra are getting fed up with having to traverse across the Tunnels carrying arduous amounts of materials. Infact, they suggest we put our efforts into repairing some of the old carriages, and using those as mobile frieght transporters. We have numerous Draisines in stockpile. With a little bit of elbow grease we can get these machines roaring once more."

  nf_PLS.56.d: "With recent turbulent times helping to accentuate the growing need to become self sufficient, now is the time to strive towards that goal.

Whether they were inhabited or not remained to be seen.\n\nWith wild gossip as our only evidence of the fabled Emerald City there were very few leads to get into contact with these supposed remnants of Moscow University. Other than the even rarer rumours of their own expeditions upon the surface."
