SAT_3b: "Of Rats and Men"
SAT_3b_desc: "Its no rumour that Timiryazevskaya was once overrun with a horde of rats many years ago. Whilst much of that former station has been demolished and replaced, still much of the carnage be seen amongst the walls and platforms. Whats worse is many swear they can hear the chittering squeaks and tapping by inumerable paws when alone. In the pipes and behind the cracked walls."
SAT_4a: "Heretical Thought"
SAT_4a_desc: "When we first gathered together after the bombs dropped, we flocked to places far removed from the world to worship. Long forgotten tombs and twisted churches to praise unspeakable names and commit even more unholy deeds. Once we found Timiryazevskaya we moved there, leaving our sites behind. If we sent a team to those long forgotten sites, perhaps we may find something of interest to aid us in our excavation?"
SAT_4b: "Call of the Cult"
SAT_4b_desc: "Once the end of days commenced, our followers flocked to unseen places beneath the earth. There we grew in numbers and our devotion soared. With revelation we knew that Armageddon gave way to unleashing hell, and that Satans house lay beneath the Moscow Metro system. In those early days we took refuge in abandoned cellars, and long-forgotten crypts. As the rest of humanity were seeking to rebuild, our acolytes were planning on bringing Satans plans into fruition."

SAT_5b_desc: "A supposed frontier of civilization in the Metro. Dimitrovskaya is sandwhiched between the hyper-capitalist hegemon of the Hanza, and the Iron fist of the Fourth Reich.
