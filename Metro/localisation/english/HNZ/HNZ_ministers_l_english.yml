  ### Country Leaders ###

  HNZ_invisible_observer: "Moscow Defence Council"
  HNZ_russia_government_remnants: "Muscovite Remnants"

  HNZ_kovalenko: "Denis Kovalenko"
  HNZ_kovalenko_desc: "§9''Time had laid hands upon his greying hairs, but had left his mind be. Carrying age like a scholar may carry books. For battle scars were worn like gleaming medals from a war fading into distant memory.''§!\n\nFormer head of Komsomolskaya station, and currently serving as the first acting president of the Unified Commonwealth of the Ring Line, Kovalenko was unanimously hailed as a hero by Anti-Communist forces for his savy political skill. His bold act to broker a temporary ceasefile with the Redline to save the lives of encircled soldiers in Komsomolskaya-Radialnaya. Eventually going on to broker the first terms of peace, a hallmark which all but guarenteed his candidacy for presidentship.\n\n"

  HNZ_zvorykine: "Vladislav Zvorykine"
  HNZ_zvorykine_desc: "§9''Tall, gaunt with a shaved head and an uncompromising air, he is a family man just over fifty, steeped in puritanical morals, religious in his own way.''§!\n\nRecently rising to power to become the acting president of the Hanseatic League, Zvorykin seeks to lead the commonwealth down an unexpected path. One of maximizing profit and aggressive optimization rather than humble ambivalence. Yet stern expression, lack of humor and constant drive to focus on only the important political matters has an undeniable magnetism which commands an audience. If the devil himself was to ever present a trick to improve productivity, there's no doubt Zvorykin wouldn't hesitate for a second."

  ## Loginov ##

  HNZ_loginov:0 "Valeri Petrovich Loginov"
  HNZ_LOGINOV_DESC:0 "The Current residing President of the Commonwealth of the Ring Line. Under his watch, he guides the relatively young Inter-stational Commonwealth through the tricky politicking of the metro. But under his careful composure is a broken man haunted by the souls of those who he gave a false hope of asylum to during the bloody Hanza-Redline war. Whilst this decision to hand over so called 'anti-revolutionary' dissenters, to the Red line, to spare his own troops was the catalyst to propel his political career. This grim truth is little more than glossed over. With the blood of men, women and children still staining his hands to this day."

  HNZ_whataburger_will:0 "The Yank"
  HNZ_whataburger_will_desc:0 "Hailing from the United States, he is often at times seen as benign and amiable. A soft-spoken man, despite his extensive knowledge in jurry-rigged firearms and retrofitted small-arms. Whilst language barriers still continue to persist, He is able and wiling to oversee our weapons production. Although folks distrust him for his nationality; the same nation of which instigated World War 3."

  HNZ_DEDUSHKA_DESC:0 "Named 'Dedushka' by younger recruits, Yasnov was a veteran, serving with distinction during the Chechen Wars in the mid 90s. With old age comes wisdom, and Yasnov is certainly that case in point. More than missing the what the world was before, he misses the fray. The snaring of bullets and rain of gunfire. Returning to give war one final spur before he finally hits the hay."
