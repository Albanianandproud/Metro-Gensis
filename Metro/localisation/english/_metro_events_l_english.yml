 nf_metro.4.d:0 "We have recieved reports of movement within the Metro tunnels, These are not the irregular movement; lumbering shambles or ratty tip-toes. Instead they uniform.. too uniform. Clearly human in origin. Although said reports few and far between."

 nf_metro.5.d:0 "Following our refusal to allow Stortbeker back within the Reich. He has instead chosen to setup his base of operations within the south. Communication between us and his brigade was already poor due to the stretch of distance.. not to forget all the hazards in the way. But now? It seems he has silenced all avanues of commuication."
