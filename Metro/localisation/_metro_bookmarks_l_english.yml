 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Genesis"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "It has been 15 years since the day of Armageddon. On that fateful day humanity drew its last breath and casted itself into extinction. With the remnants taking refuge within the dark and dingy tunnels and systems which comprise the Moscow Metro. Cultivating its own law and governance within each station. While safe from the nuclear obliteration on the surface, the constant state of perpetual war, mutant infestations and now reports of an insidious menace stirring within the decrepit dakrness. Does Humanity have any hope of survival?"

 RCH_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Formed from the remnants from far-right, ultra-nationalist organizations. Turning to the grim history of the past, as a means to survive the future. Spousing noxious propaganda for slavic unity, and genetic purity. They aspire to carve a united Metro. Free from vile mutants freaks, deformed non-slavs, and ridding of their ancestral bolshevik enemies.\n\nOne Final War. With the innevitable triumph of the Slavic peoples, to create a thousand year Reich."

 MSU_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Nestled outside beyond the bounds of the Metro, is the Fabled Emerald City. A cradle of scientific knowledge and culture, which rivals and far exceeds anything from Polis. A bastion of peace and harmony in an otherwise ignorant and harsh world. However what is actually known of their existance is little more than half-truths, incomplete rumours and tall tales from the bottom of a flask of liquor.\n\nBut just like the childrens book; its grandiose stature a mere fairy tale..."
 
 HNZ_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "A Capitalist Alliance of independant stations, which has completely subjugated the Ring Line. It boasts huge political and staggering economic power. Peacefully trading with many neutral stations.\n\nHowever having its fair share of being engaging in bloody conflict; The Hanza-Redline War in the 2020s. Personally paid the blood-toll for it. Whilst peace was eventually achieved. Feeling as a temporary ceasefire. Tension swells, The Reds re-militarize, and Nazis mobilise. Major conflict will surely come. Hanza being at its epicenter. Whether they want to or not."

 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Almost two-decades have cultivated various communities. All with their own seperate identities. Engaging in trade, diplomacy and warring amongst one another. Many of whom by and large are ignored by the bigger political turmoil. Only sharing one thing in common; survival. Struggling to meet ends in this decaying world."
