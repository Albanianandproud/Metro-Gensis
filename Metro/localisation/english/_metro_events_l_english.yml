 scavenge_mission.2.d:0 "The expeditionary team have returned, albeit, with their tails between their legs. They were unsuccessful in exploring and reclaiming what we had hoped them to achieve."

 scavenge_mission.1.d:0 "The Scavenging mission was a success. Our Stalkers have returned with goods and equipment brought back from the surface. Ontop of that they recall discovering 3 distinct spots within the ruins of Moscow we can send further expeditions to. However they believe, considering the caustic nature of the surface most of the discoveries will be picked bare or waypoints scuffled by the turbulent weather. We may only chose one of these 3 points of interest to further send an expedition to."
