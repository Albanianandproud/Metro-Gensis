  gas_mask_2013: "Basic Gas Mask"
  gas_mask_2013_desc: "A gas mask made for civilian use from before the war. They will keep a person safe from some contaminated environments, but are overall only hardly equipped to deal with the kind of places the Metro will put them up against."
  gas_mask_2029: "Improved Gas Mask"
  gas_mask_2029_desc: "An improved model of gas mask, making more dangerous areas accessable to scavengers and soldiers."
  gas_mask_2030: "Military-Grade Gas Mask"
  gas_mask_2030_desc: "A mask made specifically for the military, for use in protecting soldiers from field concentrations of chemical and biological agents, as well as radiological fallout particles."
  gas_mask_2031: "Special Forces-Grade Gas Mask"
  gas_mask_2031_desc: "A gas mask which features improved performance against chemical and biological agents, toxic industrial chemicals, and nuclear fallout. Also, a higher field of view allowance. The mask also comes with a self sealing filter mount that allow for filter changes even in contaminated environments."
  gas_mask_2032: "Spartan-Grade Gas Mask"
  gas_mask_2032_desc: "These gas masks are much the same as the previous iteration of gas mask, however, they are reinforced and allow for more extended combat encounters without as much risk to them taking damage that would cause them to be unusable."
