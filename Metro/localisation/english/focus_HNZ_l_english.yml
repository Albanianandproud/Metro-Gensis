HNZ_economic_neutrality:0 "Economic Neutrality"
HNZ_economic_neutrality_desc:0 "With great power comes responsibility - The Hanseatic League holds the most powerful position in the entire metro, that being the Ring Line. Staying oblivious to the petty conflicts that go on between independent stations is a much more economically viable option. Besides, the Horrors of the Anti-Communist war has yet to be forgotten - best yet not to replicate another horrific conflict."

HNZ_passport_requirements_desc:0 "A myriad of trade fleets and traders pass through our numerous stations many times a day. From far flung stations to the far hinterlands where the notion of humanity has been forgotten; The Hansa recieves numerous peoples passing through a day. The free-access of peoples could leave stations vulnerable to subversive activities or even sabotage. Documentation or a Passport of each passing individual will keep tabs on any potential wicked characters which may seek to do harm to the Commonwealth."

HNZ_adam_smith_legacy_desc:0 "A Scottish economist and philosopher who pioneered in early political-economic thought.

HNZ_establish_war_committee:0 "Establish The War Committee"
HNZ_establish_war_committee_desc:0 "During the Hansa-Red Line war, a war committee was formed between anti-communist coalition forces to better organise and plan tactics against the Red Line. Thankfully we haven't had to muster a organisation of that capacity since then. However with the growing tension within the Metro, forming a Committee of Station chiefs, military personnel would be an ideal operation."

HNZ_grizzled_not_another_bloodbath_desc:0 "The Conflict was utter carnage. Bodies clogged the tunnels as men and boys alike were thrown into the meat grinder with a total lack of regard. Sergei was in the thick of the fray, and lost many of his battle brothers. Yasnov remains solemnly silent about his stories of the war. Indeed so as he wishes to avoid another attritional hellhole which was the war."

A very strategic stretch of tunnels considering the fact that anyone outside the radial ring of the metro must pass through to the inner Metro.
