 AVT_perebezhchik_desc:0 "Born a few years before Armageddon and living in Chekhovskaya. Grigorev was a former Reich Stalker before his deformity. His tough and rugged demeanor in contrast with his belief with the innate goodness of people. Joining the Metromacht in his youth out of the belief to preserve his community and in doing so became a Stalker. He and his squad were sent to the surface for a routine survey. After coming into contact with an overwhelming number of mutants the squad was overrun. Whilst he barely surved the encounter, he became disfigured. The remaining members of his squad fleeing and abandoning him, believing him to be dead. Knowing if he were to return to his home, he'd be branded as a mutant and executed. Left to shamble on the surface for an entrance to the metro, Grigorev came across a Revolutionist Stalker. Naturally the two clashed for what seemed to be hours. Grigorev could barely muster to battle, but as the supplies from either of them became scarce and weather drifted, the two found futility in their efforts at destroying one another. The two began to discuss life, politics, philosophy seeing a kinship between the two. Knowing he would die if left on the surface, he asked to come with the Revolutionist, or to atleast lead him to safety. The revolutionist knew that his peers would likely not accept him, but would try to vouch for his safety in exchange for servitude and information about the Reich. Knowing his fate otherwise, Grigorev agreed. Believing that someday he would return home to Chekhovskaya to see his family."
