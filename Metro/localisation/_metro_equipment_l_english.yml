  basic_infantry_equipment_desc: "Simple and can be relied upon, the Revolver fires .44 Magnum cartridges. It is especially competent at mid to long range combat thanks to its relative decentr accuracy and firepower.

  scrap_infantry_equipment_1: "Bastard Gun"
  scrap_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "A 5.45 calibre submachine gun. Poor accuracy and overheats like hell. The Bastard Gun was created sometime after the bombs dropped. Considerably cheaper than conventional firearms, and much simpler to maintain. Its high rate of fire and decent magazine capacity is really the only thing going for this weapon. Jamming and overheating constantly - a real bastard to use."
