 VDN_industry_boost: "Procure Industrial Equipment"
 VDN_industry_boost_desc: "Although we have somewhat of a production base, we lack the proper industrial tooling and equipment to make use of much of our production capacity, in other words we have the wood but not the saw. By trading and scavenging we could attempt to acquire the proper tools to make industrialization a possibility."

 VDN_infrastructure_projects: "Infrastructure Projects"
 VDN_infrastructure_projects_desc: "Although many of our primary sectors, stations, and tunnels have previously been cleared and some even brought back to working order, much is to be done. We can mobilize our public work organization once again to clear out the rubble and establish small tram systems to cart people between our major stations, and use some of the army to clean out dangerous sections of the tunnels."

 VDN_mobilise_the_labour: "Incentivise Artisans"
