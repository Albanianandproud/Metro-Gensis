 PEC_stepanov: "Stepanov Metchnikoff"
 PEC_STEPANOV_DESC: "With age comes wisdom. But no amount of it could forsee the collapse and regression of society. Stepanov, believing he was dawning on his sunset years immediately found himself knee-deep in the proverbial shit. Reluctant at first, he found within he had a strong, natural aplitude for leadership. His peaceful, amiable governance of the republic quickly spurred on a resounding age of peace his little slice of the Metro. Although within recent years his mental state has weigned slightly; no longer as sharp as he once was. The Republic is sliding ever so slowly into the dark. But Stepanov still permeates a bold aura even his few critics cannot tilt their nose towards."
