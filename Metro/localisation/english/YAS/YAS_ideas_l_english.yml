 YAS_plague_legacy_desc:0 "In 2021 an unknown disease broke out at §YNovoyasenevskaya§! station. Brought in by stalkers returning from the surface and who were covered in blisters and with fever, it quickly broke out all across the community. With infection running high, the stations of §YNovoyasenevskaya§! and the §YBittsevsky Park§! declared independence, but ultimately did not survive the infection.\nFollowing the plague, the community seldom seeks to recreate another outbreak of this calibre ever again, and so remains dubious with contact from outsiders."
