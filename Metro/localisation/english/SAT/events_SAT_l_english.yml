The Bait was stripped clean, bones and all and only a puddle of blood remained.\n\nLike how the flood of Rats were beaten years ago with flamethrowers, we may put them to good use once again.

Huddled inside the crypy of a church. They had dug into the earth itself hoping to break into the Metro system. They had managed to grow mushrooms with limited success, though ultimately resorting to cannibalizing surface stalkers.
