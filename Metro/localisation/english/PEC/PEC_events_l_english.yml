 nf_PEC.4.t: "On Deaths Door"
 nf_PEC.4.d: "For what many had expected hesitantly, has finally arrived. Stepanov after years fighting against physical decline has finally found his end. Confide to being bedridden the old man awaits his departure. With only a few days left to live, many amongst his administration and the confederation mourn and pay their respects. The question which remains on everyone's lips continues to persist."

 nf_PEC.5.a: ""

 nf_PEC.6.t: "Bormann's Gang"
 nf_PEC.6.d: "Bormann's operations have only grown in recent months, with the disintegration of confederate authority following Stepanov's death. With his successor still up for question, Bormann's punks have slowly fanned their operations out from their turf of [409.GetName]. Bormann's initial soft spot for the Pechatniki Confederation has grown colder over the past weeks; but a soft spot still remains for the citizens beneath his Demesne."

 nf_PEC.7.t: "Baptism by Fire"

 nf_PEC.8.t: "The Esoteric Herald"
 nf_PEC.8.d: "Partially due to Stepanov recent demise, Golubev has spurred his followers into a fanatical frenzy. Espousing that the day has arrived that the southern metro must be dredged. Their god calls to him, and someplace in the deep south will his form take shape in our universe. His lackeys refuse to take work sorties, and prepare themselves for this."
 nf_PEC.8.a: "It has gotten way too out of hand, Just get rid of him."
 nf_PEC.8.b: "..."
 nf_PEC.8.b.tooltip: "Choosing this option may have DIRE consequences for the Confederation"

 nf_PEC.9.t: "The Arrival of Hastur"
 nf_PEC.9.d: "Whether to capitalize on the disintegrating state of the Confederation or purpose unknown, Golubev has riled his supports into a frenzy.

 nf_PEC.9.a: "Its arrival is soon, now is our time."

 nf_PEC.10.t: "Pechatniki Confederation"
 nf_PEC.10.d: "The Decentralized problem of the Confederation may largely only be a minor issue; compared to the Mutants from the south and Hanza encroachment to the North. However with Stepanov steering the Confederation hopefully these issues will be solved."
 nf_PEC.10.a: "Hopefully, the Confederation can steer through"

Serving as the Pakhan of the local crime syndicate, his crime outfit regularly harass and belittle merchant vessels, and attempt at charging an exorbitant amount for 'protection' passing through Kozhukhovskaya. Although unlike other bandit stations, Bormann keeps his brigands from harassing local of the Pechatniki or committing much crime at all for that matter. Only escalating tension with our forces whenever we have previously attempted to rid them out."
 nf_PEC.11.a: "That is not good"

 nf_PEC.12.t: "Dealing with the Narco-Mafia"
 nf_PEC.12.d: "Settled upon Kozhukhovskaya, Bormann's gang are firmly entrenched at that station peddling dope and coercing passing traders to pay the hefty toll. Despite seemingly wanting to keep the peace, and swearing he means no ill purpose against the Confederation our authority upon Kozhukhovskaya has waned significantly."
 nf_PEC.12.a: "They'll be a constant thorn, for sure."

 nf_PEC.13.t: "Brotherhood of the Yellow Sign"
 nf_PEC.13.d: "The Unfortunate rumours which plague Pechatniki station do indeed have some layer of truth. The majority of the population like most stations are good hardworking folk; but a few bad apples spoil the whole reputation of the bunch.\n\nSimply Referring to themselves the Brotherhood in Yellow, and draped in tattered rags - which give the impression of piss-stains rathen than yellow pigment; Golubev's rabble are no more keen on his maddened rambles as they are waiting to get their next warm meal. Believing that the apocalypse was the inaugural step into execution their plans to bring their supposed god into our realm of existence. Our security forces aren't quite sure when this Golubev individual turned up, or if he had always lived on Pechatniki station. Some believe he came wading straight from the southern tunnels themselves. Whatever the case may be, his followers have come to idolize him and much more his ideals.\n\nGolubev has accrued a rather sizable arsenal of weapons and firearms, our security forces a lead to believe. Hiding them in stashes out from prying eyes. Golubev swears certainty that their 'God' will come in corporeal form in the south, once those stations have been dredged."
 nf_PEC.13.a: "Rambles aside, we could use those weapons"
 nf_PEC.13.a.tooltip: "\nWe'll approach this Golubev fellow. As long as we don't draw ire of this small rabble, Golubev may wish to help assist our Military with his surplus.,..\n\n....Hopefully he'll tell his followers to shower, also."

 nf_PEC.15.t: "Pressure for [416.GetName]"
 nf_PEC.15.d: "Pechatniki administration have pressured us into yielding [416.GetName] and adjacent stations into their sphere of influence. They refuse the legitimacy of the current implemented administration, despite our mantle upon those stations being held for quite some time. Other than the attempt to blackmail, and threaten our forces into outright war, it is unknown how they would act if they do not get their way."

 nf_PEC.17.d: "Our attempts to demand [From.GetNameDef] to exchange [416.GetName] has been rejected, leaving [416.GetName] still in their hand. Clearly, [From.GetLeader] does not share our understanding of that station as our rightful domain. \n[Root.GetLeader] is furious, and the diplomatic options for reclaiming [416.GetName] appear to have been exhausted."

Two proponent ideas on how the resources should be spent is either upon our Armed forces or upon our Stalkers. Both decisions have their backers, and pros and cons regarding each."
