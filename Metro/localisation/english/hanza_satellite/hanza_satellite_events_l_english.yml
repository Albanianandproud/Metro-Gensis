May seek safety; entire droves of of weary refugees clutching what scarce amount they could carry stretch endlessly into the tunnels leading to our borders, their expressions laced with exhaustion and fear.\n\nOur Border administration are overwhelmed by the pleads for entry, begging for shelter. Unidentifable, and a problem that wont go away any time soon."

 nf_hanza_satellite_puppet.1.t: "Shadow over [ROOT.Capital.GetName]"
 nf_hanza_satellite_puppet.1.d: "Intelligence reports suggest that elements of organized crime have managed to expand their influence through the trade vendors entering our station. Smuggling contraband, expanding shady black market operations and racketeers of illicit goods have begun to become noticable by our administration. The fact that our local guards seemed suspiciously eager to cooperate and allow these networks to expand is something to keenly be worried about. The Hanzas official stance is all bandits should be terminated with prejudice.. Good thing we're technically not the Hanza. These bandits strike some convincing offers. Afterall; They don't have to know, do they?"
 nf_hanza_satellite_puppet.1.a: "There is no compromise with Thugs. Crack down on their operations."

Allowing their trafficked goods to flow steadily through our station unmolested for a pinch of the pie, and keeping their tracks beneath the Hanzas radar. The fact our officials have been wooed this easily with the prospect of goods is wildly concerning.. However."

 nf_hanza_satellite_puppet.3.d: "Rumours have recently circulated and have erupted into a headline. Investigative reports have uncovered extensive corruption within [406.GetName] station. Officials taking bribes, diverting Hanza funding and cooperating with local tunnel gangs who profited from illicit trade routes passing straight through Hanza territory.\n\nOur Administration is outraged, station officials of the Commonwealth are demonstrating their frustration, demanding justice and accountability of moral decay. The time for any damage control has ceased, action has to be taken."
 nf_hanza_satellite_puppet.3.a: "Inquiries wont do anything. Actions shall speak."
 nf_hanza_satellite_puppet.3.b: "Supress condemnation, we cant afford to deal with this right now."
