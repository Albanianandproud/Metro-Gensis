  rail_cart_tech_2029: "Sturdy Chassis"
  rail_cart_tech_2029_desc: "Rail Chassis refabricated from more durable materials can absorb much more tension and as a result carry more weight."
	rail_cart_tech_2032: "Improved Rollers"
  rail_cart_tech_2032_desc: "Spare rollers, and improving the rolling wheels beneath our carts will reduce the chance of sudden derailment, and further allow us to shove more pressure onto them."
	rail_cart_tech_2035: "Reinforced Hulls"
  rail_cart_tech_2035_desc: "Stronger materials; and sometimes even refabricating entirely new steel girdle entirely will improve their general durability."
	rail_salvaging_2020: "Automobile Salvaging"
  rail_salvaging_2020_desc: "Its not exactly a sortie that our Stalkers a pleasant about, but pre-war cars can be salvaged for useful spare parts. Components like engines, tanks and even internal servos can be used to better improve our Rail Draisines."
	rail_salvaging_2030: "Military Vehicle Salvaging"
  rail_salvaging_2030_desc: "Made from highly durable parts which are typically the exception in the metro. Tanks, APCs aren't going to be bolstered into our station militias, but their parts are highly sought and prized after as they can be re-purposed for railcart armour."
	rail_salvaging_2033: "Industrial Vehicle Salvaging"
  rail_salvaging_2033_desc: "Trains, trucks and anything with enough unmatched raw strength. Igor and his stalkers are going to be reluctant to lug some massive engine under the veil of darkness, but imagine what the technicians could design with the components pried off a derelict train or construction vehicle?"
	rail_bike_tech_2032: "Wiremesh Windows"
  rail_bike_tech_2032_desc: "Not exactly a comfort compared to double-glazing glass of pre-war vehicles. Wiremesh is much more resistant to stress and damage. Much better than no window at all, for that matter."
	rail_bike_tech_2034: "Mounted Ammo Box"
  rail_bike_tech_2034_desc: "Rather than having the driver or passenger have to get out from the vehicle to reload armaments; why not directly feed ammo?A mounted ammo box would easily increase both the longevity and combat effectiveness of our rail bikes."
	rail_bike_tech_2035: "Rotating Turret"
  rail_bike_tech_2035_desc: "A rotating turret can afford much more flexibility and visibility compared to just a static turret."
	rail_panzer_tech_2034: "Overlapping Armor-Plating"
  rail_panzer_tech_2034_desc: "One layer of armor isn't going to sustain much punishment before it disintegrates. Overlapping armor into layers instead of one large chunk of metal increases the protection of the cart across the board."
	rail_panzer_tech_2035: "Periscope"
  rail_panzer_tech_2035_desc: "Who would have suspected the driver would have difficulty navigating inside of a metal box? With the addition of a periscope would allow a greater capacity in visibility, and furthermore negate the risk of him getting his head shot off when opening the hatch."
	rail_engine_tech_2028: "Hand-Cranked Engine"
  rail_engine_tech_2028_desc: "Whilst labour intensive, and not particularly fast, two or a singular hand crank is far better than none at all. If your back is aching you can always take your chances and walk on foot. No? I didn't think so."
	rail_engine_tech_2030: "Basic Motor Engines"
  rail_engine_tech_2030_desc: "Slow, gurgling and not particularly efficient. These engines have seen their acclaim fade and wane and now have been called for one last sortie. Still perhaps less efficient than hand-cranked engines, but with the benefit of being faster and not needing intensive labour, If they don't break down, that is."
	rail_engine_tech_2033: "Modern Engines"
  rail_engine_tech_2033_desc: "Electrical engines with some serious horsepower behind them. Still, not as desirable as engines from the old world. But you can undoubtedly rely on them not to fall apart in the midst of battle."
	rail_armament_tech_2028: "Mounted Emplacements"
  rail_armament_tech_2028_desc: "Fixed gun, perhaps a storage box here and we can refabricate these utility carts into some proper mean looking draisines for war."
	rail_armament_tech_2029: "Armor Shields"
  rail_armament_tech_2029_desc: "Who would have suspected someone using a fixed machinegun would become a target? Mounting armoured shielding to protect its user is a no brainer, nobody would like to use the DshK gun otherwise."
	rail_armament_tech_2032: "Improved Emplacements"
  rail_armament_tech_2032_desc: "With the addition of the ability to rotate and maneuver the emplacement turret will provide a larger degree of visibility and flexibility to the user"
	rail_armament_tech_2035: "Bullet-Fed Systems"
  rail_armament_tech_2035_desc: "Rather than having to manually reload, a bullet fed system will increase the propensity to suppress targets."
	rail_armor_tech_2028: "Basic Armor"
  rail_armor_tech_2028_desc: "Sandbags, Wooden paneling or just about anything the engineers can get their hands on. Is it efficient? No. But its far better than no protection, at least."
	rail_armor_tech_2029: "Scrap Armor Plating"
  rail_armor_tech_2029_desc: "Pieces of corrugated scrap metal welded to fit around the chassis of a rail draisine. Not particularly efficient, or pretty. But good protection nonetheless."
	rail_armor_tech_2032: "Sloped Armor"
  rail_armor_tech_2032_desc: "Steeply angled armor on railcarts, bikes and even rail tanks can effectively deflect stronger munitions than armor mounted at flat angle."
	rail_armor_tech_2035: "Casted Metal"
  rail_armor_tech_2035_desc: "Rather than welding pieces together, why don't we cast the entire frame? I recall some Pindo concocted an entire bulldozer with armor to fight against the government. Only our fight is against mutants."
	rail_storage_tech_2028: "Stowage Compartments"
  rail_storage_tech_2028_desc: "Storing vital supplies, fuel and other necessary resources on the cart itself will extend their range and reduce their burden on the supply chain."
	rail_storage_tech_2030: "Improved Storage"
  rail_storage_tech_2030_desc: "Tying down items with bundles of cords, and properly sealing equipment shut might not seem like much of an improvement. But during the thick of the fray knowing equipment is securely tethered and wont be knocked out from the draisine will certainly be a comfort."
	rail_storage_tech_2033: "Improved Storage"
  rail_storage_tech_2033_desc: "Increasing the volume of fuel stored means even less need for constant deliveries from the logistical corps."

  rail_cart_tech_tachanka: "Tachanka"
  rail_car_tech_regina: "Regina"
  rail_panzer_tech_sturmpanzer: "Sturmpanzer"
  rail_armored_train_tech: "Armored Train"
