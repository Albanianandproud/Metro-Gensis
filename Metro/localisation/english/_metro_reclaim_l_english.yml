 reclaimation_event.4.d.a: "As our suspisions were proven correct, the Depot was infact inhabited. Not by mutants, as predicted by our excavation team, but as a matter of fact humans. Rather shrewd humans at that. As hostilities between our excavation party and the inhabitants ceased following an intensive standoff which almost culminated in a skirmish, the Depot inhabitants finally confide themselves to our team after being provided with adequate food and water.\n\nFormer citizens of Park Pobedy before the tunnel between the station and Arbatskaya was collapsed, these inhabitants fled the station as the situation drew dire. Rather chosing to risk receeding further into the metro than the general bedlam and disorder which was occuring to the remnants. Finding this Depot to hunker down, and scouring the nearby tunnels for valuable resources a few of the remnants turned to Stalker duties collecting resources upon the surface. For a while, their situation was harsh, but livable; even with a working water purifier and being able to cultivate some of the mushrooms growing in the tunnels as a meagre food supply. Trading with any nearby sorties on the surface. Their leader, who hoisted the group out from Park Pobedy to settle at the Depot, mysteriously vanishing several weeks prior. They had resorted to draw short straws as they began fall to malnutrition. Until they encountered our team."
 reclaimation_event.4.d.b: "As our suspisions were proven correct, the Depot was infact inhabited. Not by mutants, as predicted by our excavation team, but as a matter of fact humans who have began to open fire upon our sorties with strange firearms. As to be considered, concerning their pitiful disposition."
 reclaimation_event.4.a: "We'll allow them in with open Arms!"
 reclaimation_event.4.b: "To Arms!"

 scavenge_mission.1.t:0 "Scavengers Return Successfully"
 scavenge_mission.1.d:0 "The Scavenging mission was a success. Our Stalkers have returned with goods and equipment brought back from the surface. Ontop of that they recall discovering 3 distinct spots within the ruins of Moscow we can send further expeditions to. However they believe, considering the caustic nature of the surface most of the discoveries will be picked bare or waypoints scuffled by the turbulent weather. We may only chose one of these 3 points of interest to further send an expedition to."
