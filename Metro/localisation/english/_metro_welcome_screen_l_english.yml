 METRO_TAB_1_TXT: "Welcome to the Metro mod. This mod is currently being worked on by a small team of passionate developers. As it currently stands, the mod is in Beta. Numerous fundamental features are being added or changed to the mod. The mod is thus in a transitional phase where the core gameplay loop is being drastically changed from base HOI4.\n\nBecause of this, expect to encounter numerous bugs, glitches and unintended issues. Fixes should be gradually rolled out over time. With decent conent updates rolling out every other month or so.\n\nIf you encounter any bugs or glitches, it would be greatly appreciated if you would let us know on our Discord server or through Steam. If you have any suggestions, constructive criticism or feedback please reach out to us. We would greatly appreciate it.\n\n\nWe hope you will enjoy the mod! Happy hunting STALKERS\n\n-Metro Genesis Dev Team"

 METRO_TAB_2_TXT: "§YScavenging§!\n\nThe Pockmarked ruins of the Moscow Metro have been picked and scoured clean of much of its valuables, but some loot still remains waiting to be unearthed by daring adventurers. §YScavenging§! is a mechanic available to the vast majority of nations which represents the near tireless duty of §RStalkers§! unearthing pre-war relics upon the surface. §YScavenging§! Sorties may be launched through the §CDecisions Tab§!, and the outcome of a successful chance may be improved through researching various £research_icon §CTechnologies§!. A successful scavenge may provide £infantry_equipment_text_icon §YEquipment§! not currently researched, £research_bonus_texticon §YResearch Bonuses§!, £resources_texticon §YResources§! or even rare and often elusive §CSchematics - Unique Technology§!!\n\n\n§YColonization§!\n\nIn the decade and a half since Humanity sought refuge underground, the §RMoscow Metro§! has gradually decayed and been left to rot. Many Subway Lines and Stations lay abandoned if not outright destroyed through nuclear damage or exposed to the crippling effects of radiation. Certain Nations however may be able to launch §CColonization Sorties§! into neighbouring §YRuined§! states, setting up temporary stockades in the attempt of reeling those Stations into your Administration. Certain nations however, such as §Y[RCH.GetName]§! may not have immediate access to §YColonization§! on game-start, and only through §CFocus Rewards§! or §CDecisions§!, unlock the ability to §YColonize§!.\n\n\n§YCoring§!\n\nEvery Nation is capable of integrating §RNon-Core§! States into their administration. Costing a large sum of £political_power_texticon §YPolitical Power§! and requiring the §Rnon-core§! state in question having over §Y95%§! £compliance_texticon §YCompliance§!.\n\n\n§YEducation§!\n\nA new Law category has been implemented to represent Illiteracy and Scientific advancements in the Metro. Education is the measured level of preservation of pre-war levels of knowledge your society holds, with lower Education levels reducing £research_speed_texticon §YResearch speed§! and £army_doctrine_cost_texticon §YDoctrine Cost§!. Education laws may be improved through §YEducation Reforms§! in the §YDecisions§! tab. However certain nations, namely §RSavage§! societies such as §Y[GWC.GetName]§! or §Y[PAG.GetName]§! cannot improve this whatsoever. §RBandit§! nations such as §Y[MOB.GetName]§! or §Y[TRT.GetName]§! also may not advanced beyond Primary Education.\n\n\n§YBullet Economy§!\n\nAfter the conclusion of the §YThird World War§!, the economic system of §YRussia§! collapsed. Pre-War money became irrelevent, or fuel for fires as £bullet_income §CBullets§! ubiquitously became the main currency in the §RMoscow Metro§!. £bullet_income §CBullets§! are used for almost everything. From Paying wages of active duty soldiers, purchasing armaments, to funding expeditions to the surface. £bullet_income §CBullet§! Income and Expenses are calculated each month. Income and Expenses such as §YWorkshop Tarrifs§! or §CTechnician Wages§! may also be modified through certain §YNational Spirits§! or §CCivic§! Laws. All nations currently have an unlimited supply capacity of £bullet_income §CBullet§!.\n\n\n§YResearch§!\n\n§YResearch§! has also been altered from Vanilla HOI4. Representing the §RMoscow Metro§! much closer. §YSupport Weapons§! such as §YFlamethrowers§! or §YLight Machine Guns§! are now §YSupport Slots§!, whilst §YInfantry§! Equipment has been expanded. £industry_texticon §YIndustrial§! Technologies have been changed significantly and now reflects basic industrial progress as well as improving the quality of life of your citizenry.\nResearch May also be 'stolen' from a defeated country in war, and after the peace conference has concluded. The Victors will have a chance to recieve £research_bonus_texticon §YResearch Bonuses§! to £research_icon §YTechnologies§! the defeated nation has researched.\n\n\n"
