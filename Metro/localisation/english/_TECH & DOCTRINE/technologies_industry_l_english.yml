 # Construction #
 tech_construction_rag_tents:0 "Rag Tents"
 tech_construction_rag_tents_desc:0 "Before the civil war, most folk could sleep fine underneath the painted Metro ceilings. Now you'd be lucky if you could get good nights rest, if water dripping from the walls didn't wake you, the distant rattles of gunfire or stories of mutants prowling amongst the dark would. Construction of housing made out of bits of fabricated and stitched cloth isn't the greatest to keep out the elements, but it'll do."

 tech_construction_tarpaulin:0 "Tarpaulin"
 tech_construction_tarpaulin_desc:0 "Heavier, but also water resistant. Abodes constructed from Tarps is leagues better than cloth. Its nothing oppulent to boast about, but far better than having water seeping through as you sleep.

 tech_construction_wood:0 "Wood"
