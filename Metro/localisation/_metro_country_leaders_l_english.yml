Being the son of a former Colonel in the Soviet Army he always felt he had something to live up to. Feeling dejected from not being able to follow in his fathers footsteps.\n\nNow? He lives life with a clear purpose; to defend §Yhis§! station. §YHis§! family. §YHis§! home. He will personally see to it that §YKrylatskoe§! station remains safe and secured from outside threats. And with reports of §RMutants§! in the tunnels to the south, he will do whatever it takes to live up to his fathers legacy."

 politics_MIT_valentinovich_desc:0 "Head of Mitino Station, Semyon was born sometime in the 60s and was able to escape into the Subway. A strong-shouldered man at first glance, but deep within shattered and broken. Semyon lost much to the war, too much infact, and he fell into a deep depression. The bottle being his only acquaintance; and a belly full of liquor provides him of any respite from this decaying world.\n\nHowever, all that changed when he accompanied stalkers venturing forth onto the surface. With every expedition, came success, thanks inpart to Semyon sharp eyes and expertise in scouting and navigating the treacherous ruins of Moscow.\n\nValentinovich regained his composure and conscious; His vigour and life returned, dropping the bottle in exchange for overseeing the Commonwealth."
