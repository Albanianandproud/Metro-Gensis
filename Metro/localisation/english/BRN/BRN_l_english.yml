  BRN_3_desc: "The passage leading to the Ring line as one would expect is choked to the brim with defense fortifications and patrolled heavily by Hanza forces. Tough to talk, and taking no shit from anyone. Perhaps theres a thing or two to learn from watching them."

  BRN_8A: "Purchasing Power"
  BRN_8A_desc: "Sometimes the Hanseatic Borderguards may try to sell us their old machineguns during their unusually short smoke breaks at a significantly marked up price.

  BRN_16: "Community Workshops"
  BRN_16_desc: "Designating a place where our managers may come, and make quotas for resources or work as needed will go a long way to improve our stations image. Perhaps we may even get the station tiles scrubbed?"

Sometimes the shortest twig, others the longest."

  BRN_32: "The Gutter Syndicate"
  BRN_32_desc: "As one would expect, Bandits and convicts too make [BRN.capital.GetName] their own. With their simple schemes and meagre rackets far too insignificant for our administration to crack down. Though too the occasional attempt to smuggle contraband across the Hanza."

Those who stay jobless for long seem to move to places elsewhere, almost as if they got up and left in a hurry. Without a trace"
  BRN_35: "Rags and Riches"
  BRN_35_desc: "Mutants are thankfully not a problem. With the majority of the population barring virtually none genetic deformities the fear of mutant men among us remains slim. Those merchants who arrive draped in rags and refuse to take off their respirators at the checkpoint however arouse some suspicion. If it werent for their decent wares, and pockets full of bullets they'd of been ousted already."

  nf_BRN.1.t: "Werwolf"
  nf_BRN.1.d: "Sometimes we might get the infrequent Reich soldier or stalker at our station, waiting for orders back from Tverskaya. Sometimes orders arrive from other arriving soldiers or even station informants. However one Reich soldier has been waiting, and waiting for orders to return. Its been close to a year now, still no assignments. He'd quickly return to base, if it werent the increasingly tightening standards of the Reich. Undoubtedly, he would fail."
  nf_BRN.1.a: "Perhaps he might be inclined to serve our station?"
  nf_BRN.1.b: "Theres always the odd job you may do, to bide your time."
  nf_BRN.2.t: "Relax, Take it Easy"
  nf_BRN.2.d: "An retired prospector resides at our station. Spending his old years post-war looking for work, or the occasional bit of scrap or eletronics to sell, but when he got too old soon retired. He still keeps a large stash of dynamite locked away in his quaters, a rather sizable arsenal if we are to believe. Perhaps with some convincing we might persuade him to give them up?"
  nf_BRN.2.a: "Out of retirement, just for a while longer.."

  nf_BRN.3.t: "The Three Tankists"
  nf_BRN.3.d: "The infrequent rail cart arrives to our station, Not staying for long and only making frugal purchases from the markets. From word of our soldiers, and traders who have managed to get more than several terse words from them they are former Redline soldiers, disollusioned with the regime in [RED.Capital.GetName], and sought it out on their own path. Then soon enough became disollusioned with the revolutionists, who they worked alongside. They now roam the Metro in their makeshift trolly, serving whoever pays well enough, fighting off the urge to revert to simply banditry and thuggery to make a living. Perhaps they might find a home, and service here.
  nf_BRN.3.a: "A mobile brigade? We could use one of those..."
  nf_BRN.3.b: "Their purchases serve us more than adequately."
  nf_BRN.4.t: "Dreams of Crulty"
  nf_BRN.4.d: "A vagrant lives in the tunnels, catching the occasional oversized rodent to sell as food to our butchers. While its a good thing that the rat population has been kept in check thanks to them, the ghastly sight and smell of him remains to be thankful for. Thought to be feral, or a wildman at first sight it became clear from the tattered rags and stencilled markings on its stained outfit they were a former satanist. Beneath its drunken and slurring grunts, one has to shudder what remains beneath the cowl. What dreams of chronic and sustained crulty that even the satanists were unnerved by. Glad its on our side."
  nf_BRN.4.a: "If it keeps the mutants at bay.."
  nf_BRN.4.b: "Perhaps the furthest stretches of the tunnels suit  you better"
  nf_BRN.5.t: "Ratmen?"
  nf_BRN.5.d: "Sometimes a secret if worth far more than a handful of bullets. Two foreign traders were held in custody by our forces under the suspicion of being mutants. They had been routine traders, coming to the station every other week or so to purchase food, or the odd book on sale. After a spat, where the traders refused to take off their respirators and show their faces to the authority they were held. After terse back and forth with our administration, in fear of word of traders getting kicked in would spread like wildfire and deter customers they were soon released."
  nf_BRN.5.a: "Perhaps some of their soldiers may be of service"
  nf_BRN.5.b: "Their trade is fine enough"
  nf_BRN.6.t: "Expanding the Military Committee"
  nf_BRN.6.d: "With our meagre military forces stretched as far as they can tangibly go and the black cloud of future conflict looming ever so closer, we may have to turn to an unconventional solution. Drawn with the promise of fortune, these seasoned warriors from across the Metro shall answer our call. For a small fee. Some may disaprove with this, filling our own command roster with those who swear no allegiance beyond the prospect of bullets. Regardless, they are a vital source of experience we desperately need."
  nf_BRN.6.a: "Their loyalty can be turned aside, for bullets ofcourse."
