 STG_strogino:0 "Strogino Station"
 STG_strogino_desc:0 "Cut off from its neighbouring stations. It is surprising to see the station of Strogino remains a relatively decent home compared to the rest of the metro. Coupled with the fact that the station itself is rather larger than its sibling stations of the §YArbatsko-Pokrovskaya§! Line and fewer folks reside here, life is decent; hard, but bearable."
