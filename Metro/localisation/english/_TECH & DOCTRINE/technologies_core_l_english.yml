  doctrine_A_2: "Improvised Combat"

  doctrine_A_11: "Citizenry Obligations"
  doctrine_A_11_desc: "We cannot solely rely upon volunteers to fill out the ranks of our armed forces. It must be instilled to every one of our citizens that servitude is non-negotiable and everyone is liable to be called to duty."

  doctrine_A_13: "Force Multiplication"

  doctrine_B_7: "Basic Field Kits"
  doctrine_B_7_desc: "We do not expect our soldiers to perform medical miracles out on the battlefield. However with the required equipment they may be able to stabilize major injuries, buying enough time to be treated behind the frontlines."

  squadron_1: "Coordinated Instructors"
  squadron_1_desc: "Anyone can hold and gun and be told to shoot. Our Armed forces vary wildly in tactics and in skills. From those with extensive pre-war knowledge to those who have lived their entire lives beneath peeling white-washed ceilings. Collectivizing the best of this knowledge so that it can put to good usage should be our first fundamental step into reforming our armed forces."
  squadron_2: "Force Rotation"
  squadron_2_desc: "We must remember as much as we hate the ravaging, feral mutant beast infront of us we hold our families and loved ones behind us with love. Our soldiers are not infallable machines. Fixed rotation times between the front, reserves and off-duty will undoubtedly rejuvinate our armed soldiers."  
  squadron_3: "Conscription Standards"

  squadron_10: "Maneuver warfare"
  squadron_10_desc: "Emphasizing movement, and quick thorough thinking and initiative to achieve a position of advantage will reduce the likelyhood of incurring casualty losses. Engaging in disrupting enemy forces through maneuvers, rather than engagements"  
  squadron_11: "Case-Method Training"
  squadron_11_desc: "Everyone knows of the great patriotic war, the trenches of verdun to the Napoleonic campaign into Russia. But what of recent engagements?

  squadron_12: "War Has Changed"
