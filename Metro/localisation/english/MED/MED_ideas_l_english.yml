  MED_station_of_stalkers: "Station of Stalkers"
  MED_station_of_stalkers_desc: "At the tail end of the §YKaluga-Rizhskaya§!, Stalkers in great abundance gather under the illustrious prospect of loot and glory. Used as a launchpad to explore the far northern climbs of Moscow untouched and untainted by the grubby hands of prospectors. The whole station is ran, organized by Stalkers and their daily operations."
  MED_hates_skaven: "Launchpad into Serpukhovsko-Timiryazevskaya"
  MED_hates_skaven_desc: "One other reason for the inhabitation of §YMedvedkovo§! is as a station post for forays into §YSerpukhov-Timiryazevskaya§! line - estranged from the rest of the Metro ever since the rat incursion at §YTimiryazevskaya§! Rumours circulate that those stations are infact inhabited. Not by man nor rat, but by a ghastly and unholy mutation of the two."
