Whatever way people may have found in the past to justify where [From.GetName] ends and [Root.GetName] begins, we live in a new era. The strategic importance of this border cannot be overstated, and we are well within our rights to shift it to ensure the continued security of our people.'\n\nListening to [From.GetLeader]'s recent speeches, an invasion of [Root.GetName] appears imminent. Dissenting voices have objected, but public support for war is on the rise."

 war_justification.218.d:0 "'There is no doubt that [Root.GetName] is preparing for war. The changes in economic policy make it plain to see that the [Root.GetAdjective] are not a people of peace, but rather waiting for the right opportunity to strike against us. Will we stand idly by and watch them arm themselves while [From.GetName] is undefended? Or will we disarm this threat before it grows beyond our power?'\n\nThe hawks in the [From.GetRulingParty] have turned their eyes towards [Root.GetName], arguing that attack is the best defense. Their viewpoint is gaining traction and [From.GetName] is preparing for war."

 war_justification.219.d:0 "'Those naïve citizens of [From.GetName] who imagine the [Root.GetAdjective] as a people of peace are entirely out of touch with reality. Those who live at our border do not have the luxury of such delusions, seeing their troops closing in on us just across it. This is a threat we cannot leave unanswered. With every passing day, [Root.GetName] is preparing for war. It would be madness for us not to do the same.'\n\nOur military presence close to [From.GetAdjective] territory has sparked increased concern, since they interpret our troop movements as proof hostile intent. They hardly seem to have considered that their aggressive rhetoric is the reason for our defensive measures."

This is about safeguarding our children's futures and ensuring that [From.GetName] has a place in the world of tomorrow. This is a matter of devotion to our cause and the ideals we take for granted. It's time to act.'\n\nA series of rousing speeches from [From.GetRulingParty] leaders, most prominently [From.GetLeader], has been calling the public to support an invasion of [Root.GetName]. The geopolitical motives behind the invasion are less prominent in the rhetoric to patriotic sentiments, but this campaign appears highly efficient in convincing the public of its necessity."

Not only is this yet another damning case in a string of missed opportunities to strengthen [Root.GetName]'s position internationally, it is a sign that their claim to be acting in the interest of the [Root.GetAdjective] people is mostly empty rhetoric. It is time for a change in policy.'\n\nOur failure to pursue the war many had expected has been the target of scathing criticism from our political opponents. Not following through on our military plans will make it more difficult for us to convince the people in which direction we're taking [Root.GetName]."
