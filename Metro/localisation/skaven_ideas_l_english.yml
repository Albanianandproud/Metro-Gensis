 ratfolk:0 "Skaven"
 ratfolk_desc:0 "Mutated Humans who inhabit the northern stations of the Serpukhov-Timiryazev Line. When a rat horde swept through Timiryazevskaya in 2014, those who could not flee to Dmitrovskaya were subject to feral hordes of rats.\n\nThose who survived however became infected with diseases. Those who tried to seek refuge in nearby stations were denied any help, and shot to prevent the spread of the infection. Forced to stay put, the people slowly adapted to the virus, and were forever changed. With each new generation, become much more 'rat-like' in appearance; black irises, thicker nails and pronounced features.\n\nDespite these changes, they are very much so human in intellect, speech and culture. But the 'clean' humans from the Big metro think otherwise, and generally consider them little more than vile mutants."

 skaven:0 "Unity of Skaven Stations"
 skaven_desc:0"Comprised of Skaven, the Unity of Skaven Stations is a Commonwealth comprised of Bibirevo, Otradnaya and Vladykino. The Triple C form a biohazard symbol, amusingly to 'scare' non-skaven away from their domain. Flaunting their mutated-disposition in the attempts to be left alone by humans. Despite this, The Station places great effort into the preservation and continuation of their 'humanity'. Education, culture and learning are all incentivised. It could be argued, that the Skaven have retained alot more of their humanity than most communities in the Grand Metro."
