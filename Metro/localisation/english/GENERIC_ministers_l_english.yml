  _metro_scientist:0 "Scientist from Polis"
  _metro_scientist_desc:0 "A former Brahmin from Polis. His eccentric, yet dubious methods of collecting, and carrying out scientific information drew the ire of many of his former colleagues. He took to the wider metro to further his understanding in scientific knowledge. Prefering the bedlam and freedom rather than the systematic methods, rational and 'principled' means back at Polis."

  _metro_strings_puller_desc:0 "Knowing how to discretely and covertly manupulate political ongoings to control and influence others into to his way of thinking, he found a relatively easy time conforming to the inner-politiking of the Metro. Never afraid to use underhanded tactics, though always prefering to keep his hands clean."
  
  _metro_accountant:0 "Former Accountant"
  _metro_accountant_desc:0 "Working a dead-end office job before the Apocalypse would probably equate to nil-chances of survival in the aftermath. However instead he found his frugal and shrewd talents were put to good usage; managing and overseeing the logistical aspects of a post-nuclear society. Though just like before, still being relagated to menial, bureaucratic jobs. Though this time his work meaning the survival of the human race, rather than profits to a indignant corporation."
