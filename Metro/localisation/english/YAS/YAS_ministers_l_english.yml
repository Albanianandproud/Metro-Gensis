 YAS_BRITVIN_DESC:0 "§Y...A baldly shaved skull, a large forehead, thick straight eyebrows, steel eyes, narrow lips, a heavy chin with a scar. On the mighty neck on a simple thread there is a cross, and next to it - on a chain - an officer's badge with a personal number...§!\n\nFollowing the demise of the former head of state during the outbreak at Bittsevsky Park, Pyotr Britvin took the mantle of power within the community and soon afterwards became the undisputed leader. Maintaining a strict degree of militarism, and exhorting discipline amongst his community, Britvin remains wary of contact with the outside world. Choosing instead to remain withdrawn in fear of another catastrophe would stricken the community he oversees again."
