 emerald_city_desc:0 "Emerald City forming from the refuge of students and professors from Moscow State University, it is rumoured that if it exists, it would house the brightest minds in the world\n\n However isolated from the destruction of Vorobyovy Gory, isolating the University from the rest of the Metro.\n\nIts existance is obscure, devolved into half-true truths and incomplete rumours. With accounts of stalkers encountering scientific expeditions sent from Moscow up on the surface.\n\n Whether they exist or not is up for debate. However the Red Line refuse to acknowledge even the mere notion of its existance."
