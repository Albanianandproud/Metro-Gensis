From those with extensive pre-war knowledge to those who have lived their entire lives beneath peeling white-washed ceilings. Collectivizing the best of this knowledge so that it can put to good usage should be our first fundamental step into reforming our armed forces."
  squadron_2: "Force Rotation"
  squadron_2_DESC: "We must remember as much as we hate the ravaging, feral mutant beast in front of us we hold our families and loved ones behind us with love. Our soldiers are not infallible machines. Fixed rotation times between the front, reserves and off-duty will undoubtedly rejuvenate our armed soldiers."

  squadron_11: "Case-Method Training"
  squadron_11_DESC: "Everyone knows of the great patriotic war, the trenches of verdun to the Napoleonic campaign into Russia. But what of recent engagements?

  squadron_12: "War Has Changed"
