 nf_SPT.1.t:0 "Resource Shortages"
 nf_SPT.1.d:0 "Hello Commander. We are in dire need of more resources. Our technicians and gunsmiths require many pieces of equipment which our station currently lacks. Our military force feels the squeeze from the lack of ample, decent equipment and they won't hide their discontent for much longer. Whilst we may trade for required resources with our neighbours, a much more ideal solution is to trek out onto the surface and find them ourselves. We are the Rangers afterall, we should not need to be tethered to one polity or another for support.\n\nWe have found several key locations which are a great place to begin salvaging. I hope you trust our plan, General sir."
 nf_SPT.1.a:0 "It is a good plan indeed"

 nf_SPT.2.t:0 "Salvaging Operations: Addendum"
 nf_SPT.2.d:0 "Even though the voyage to the surface was difficult and by no means an easy feat, our Spartans were successful in their mission. They key sites we had initially planned to salvage from remained initially intact. Other than erosion from weather and debris they were left untouched. We'll be able to set up a rudmientary outpost in this spot for the meantime, and carry resources back and to our station. This should surely help ameliorate our resource shortages."
 nf_SPT.2.a:0 "A boon to our production, but we need more resources"
 nf_SPT.2.b:0 "A decent salvage, but still lacking"
 nf_SPT.2.c:0 "Our stores are full; that should be enough resources for the meantime."
