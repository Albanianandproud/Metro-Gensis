 reclaimation_event.mutants.t:0 "Mutant Attacks"
 reclaimation_event.mutants.d:0 "The Colonisation team we sent into the Metro were viciously attacked by feral mutants. Most of the team was slain, the few that escaped wounded or scarred for life. This loss will not be in vain!"

 reclaimation_event.3.a:0 "Their loss will not be forgotten!"

 nf_metro.4.t:0 "Fascists in the Depths"
 nf_metro.4.d:0 "We have recieved reports of movement within the Metro tunnels, These are not the irregular movement; lumbering shambles or ratty tip-toes. Instead they uniform.. too uniform. Clearly human in origin. Although said reports few and far between."
 nf_metro.4.a:0 "We have more than the rats to worry about"

 nf_metro.5.t:0 "Breakaway Reich"
 nf_metro.5.d:0 "Following our refusal to allow Stortbeker back within the Reich. He has instead chosen to setup his base of operations within the south. Communication between us and his brigade was already poor due to the stretch of distance.. not to forget all the hazards in the way. But now? It seems he has silenced all avanues of commuication."
 nf_metro.5.a:0 "Ok"
