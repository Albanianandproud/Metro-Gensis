 improve_education_access_polis_repository:0 "Access Polis' libraries"
 improve_education_access_polis_repository_desc:0 "We're sitting in the dark trying to reinvent the lightbulb whilst Polis retains any information that we may seek. Instead of banging sticks and stones together we could politely ask if we are allowed access to their knowledge reserves. Albeit distrusting of permanently lending us any books or pieces of knowledge to keep, incase of some idiot mistaking possibly the last intact book from Dostoyevsky as fire kindling. Surely a community dedicated to the preservation of humanity and the safeguarding of knowledge would let us take a brief peek?"

 improve_education_efforts_HANZA_unique_1: "Invest in our Research Base"

We cant exactly throw money at our populace, and expect them to become literate. However can can afford to 'place' some spare change here and there. Especially when it comes to our Administrative base. Sure, the station walls are leaking slime again, and Igors scrap-gun has jammed for the upteenth time today, but we could really do with some more books."

 improve_education_bandit_desc:0 "The word 'bright' or smarts doesn't come to mind when it comes to a band of thugs and goons. Street-smarts sure, but how many hoodlums does it take to screw in a lightbulb? Better not asking that around these parts. Though its clear if we're going to be running the underground we'd better start somewhere. Whipping the lads into shape from being a disparate band of boneheads."
