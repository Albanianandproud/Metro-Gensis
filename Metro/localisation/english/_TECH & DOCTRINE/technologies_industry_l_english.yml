 # Construction #
 tech_construction_rag_tents:0 "Rag Tents"
 tech_construction_rag_tents_desc:0 "Before the Civil War, most people could sleep soundly under the painted ceilings of the Metro. Now, you'll be lucky if you can get a good night's sleep without being woken by dripping water, distant gunfire, or stories of mutants lurking in the dark. Building a shelter from scraps of stitched and sewn fabric isn't the best way to protect yourself from the elements, but it'll do."

 tech_construction_tarpaulin:0 "Tarpaulin"
 tech_construction_tarpaulin_desc:0 "Heavier, but also more waterproof. Canvas shelters are much better than fabric ones. It's not a luxury to brag about, but it's much better than water seeping through you while you sleep."

 tech_construction_wood:0 "Wood"
 tech_construction_wood_desc:0 "A hard to come by material underground, it can be salvaged from trees during surface expeditions. It's sturdy, easy to shape, can be made waterproof, and looks quite nice."

 tech_construction_scrap_metal:0 "Scrap Metal"
 tech_construction_scrap_metal_desc:0 "Metal, being both more abundant and stronger than wood, is the next step in the evolution of metro housing. Though the walls rattle, nobody is going to knock them down with an axe!"

 tech_construction_bricks:0 "Bricks"
 tech_construction_bricks_desc:0 "Cheap, incredibly sturdy, and purpose built for construction. Bricks are the first sign that people will return to normal life in the metro as they once may have enjoyed in the past."

 tech_construction_concrete:0 "Concrete"
 tech_construction_concrete_desc:0 "Concrete can be poured into molds, transported easily, and used for floors, walls, and even roofs! It's a wonderful material, used since Roman times."

 tech_construction_graphene_concrete: "Graphene Concrete"
 tech_construction_graphene_concrete_desc: "Graphene is tough and flexible, and concrete is rigid and strong. Combination of the two is supposed to reduce the material cost of construction whilst still serving the same structural performance."

 # Tooling # 
 tech_tooling_campfire: "Campfires"
 tech_tooling_campfire_desc: "Fire. Invented by monkeys 60 thousand years ago. Other than the succor of warmth from sitting besides an exposed flame it has a multitude of uses; from cooking, to lighting to burning bodies."
