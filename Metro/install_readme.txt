( MAKE SURE YOU ARE NOT SUBSCRIBED TO THE METRO MOD ON THE WORKSHOP )

1. Move the folder to where your local mod files are located. For most people it is 'Documents/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod'. If needed to overwrite click yes.

2. Copy the file named 'descriptor.mod'  and place it in the 'mod' folder (sitting alongside the 'Metro' folder you created in the last step).

3. Rename the file you copied to 'Metro.mod'. Open this file, and add the line `path="mod/Metro"` to the very end and save.

4. Hopefully, this should have worked and the Mod should be seen in the launcher. The Metro now calls. Heed forth its call.
