 HUL_BATKA_DESC:0 "Called §YUncle Misha§! by his fellow comrades, Mikhails plain appearance and shy nature betrays the great resounding fire which rests within him. His speeches can still even the most rowdiest of hungry crowds and move the most grumpiest of station guards into silence. Many who follow his teachings proclaim him as Nestor, after Nestor Makhno himself, and whilst the Republic has yet to see any mass movements outside the north-western sect of the §YZamoskvoretskaya§! line, one fact remains abundantly clear; §RFreedom or Death!§!"
